Activity-dependent changes in gene expression involving the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) occur in learning and
memory, pain, and drug addiction. This mechanism may
also be important for cytomegaloviral infections of the
brain. The human cytomegalovirus major immediateearly promoter/enhancer (hCMV promoter), rate-limiting for productive cytomegalovirus infection, contains
five cAMP-response elements (CREs). Indirect evidence
suggests that this promoter does not function in unstimulated neurons. Here we test the hypothesis that
expression from the hCMV promoter in neurons is induced by membrane depolarization. For these experiments, we infected cultured sympathetic and hippocampal neurons with hCMV-green fluorescent protein (GFP)
promoter/reporter constructs using adenoviral gene
transfer techniques and measured transgene expression
by quantifying GFP fluorescence and GFP mRNA levels.
We found that depolarization up-regulates promoter
activity by >90-fold. Moreover, our results from pharmacological experiments suggest that this induction occurred through a CREB-dependent pathway. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis of all five CREs in the
promoter blocked this up-regulation almost completely,
whereas mutating four of them had no effect. We conclude that the hCMV promoter acts as a molecular
switch in neurons and is strongly induced by membrane
depolarization, neuronal activity, or other stimuli that
activate CREB. These results may provide insight into
molecular mechanisms of cytomegalovirus-related diseases of the brain.

Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV)1 infections, often harmless
in healthy individuals, produce numerous debilitating symptoms in those with immature or impaired immune systems. In
persons with AIDS, for example, cytomegalovirus infections
cause severe neurological disorders (1); in infants, congenital
infections cause impaired brain growth, mental retardation,
and progressive motor deficits (2). Therefore, it is important to

understand the mechanisms for cytomegalovirus production in
the nervous system. Productive cytomegaloviral infections require transcription of immediate-early genes in the viral genome (3, 4). Expression of these genes is controlled by the
hCMV major immediate-early promoter/enhancer (hCMV promoter) (5). As activity of this promoter is rate-limiting for
productive viral infection, many groups have studied how this
promoter functions to understand the molecular mechanisms of
cytomegalovirus infections. The hCMV promoter is highly enriched with a densely packed array of cis-elements (3) and is
among the strongest known promoters in mammalian cells. As
such, it is commonly used to drive the expression of foreign
genes in a wide variety of cell types.
Surprisingly, the hCMV promoter appears not to function
well in neurons. For example, studies using primary cortical
cultures indicate that the hCMV promoter expresses transgenes well in glia but not in neurons (6). Furthermore, in mice
transgenic for hCMV promoter-reporter constructs, only a few
neurons express the transgene (7, 8), indicating that hCMV
promoter activity is low in most neurons. That a few neurons
express the transgene at high levels suggests that neurons
regulate promoter activity.
In preliminary experiments on neurons expressing foreign
genes under the control of the hCMV promoter, we observed
that depolarization induced a dramatic up-regulation of transgene expression suggesting that activity-dependent mechanisms modulate hCMV promoter function. Consistent with this
idea, the hCMV promoter contains a number of cis-elements
that bind transcription factors thought to be regulated by neuronal activity; these include, five cAMP response elements
(CRE), four NF-␬B-binding sites, an AP-1 site, and a serumresponse element (SRE) (3).
Because we are interested in the molecular mechanisms
underlying activity-dependent gene expression, and because
activity-dependent mechanisms may lead to the progression of
hCMV infections in the brain, we furthered our preliminary
findings to determine if depolarization regulates the hCMV
promoter. In addition, since elevating cAMP in non-neuronal
cell lines increases hCMV promoter function (9 –13), we examined the role of the five CREs in the promoter. Our results show
that hCMV promoter activity in neurons is up-regulated
⬎90-fold by depolarization. Site-directed mutagenesis of the
CREs in the promoter blocked the depolarization-induced expression by over 95% indicating that the CREs mediate this
induction.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Sympathetic Neuron Cultures—We cultured superior cervical ganglia (SCG) neurons from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River,
Canada) as described previously (14), except we used trypsin (180
units/ml, Worthington) for 30 min instead of dispase/collagenase. In
some experiments, we centrifuged the cell suspension through a Percoll
gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to decrease the relative contribution of non-neuronal cells to these cultures. In experiments where

infected with adenoviral vectors containing hCMV-GFP reporter constructs. SCG neurons were infected overnight with an adenovirus containing an
hCMV-GFP reporter construct at day 5 in
vitro and stimulated with 40 mM K⫹ 2
days later. The same field was photographed at 0, 3.5, and 7 h after stimulation. The top panels are phase-contrast
micrographs, and the bottom panels are

we did not take this precaution, the fold increase in GFP mRNA induced
by depolarization was significantly less. Cultures were fed every 3 days
and treated with cytosine arabinoside (10 ␮M; Sigma) from days 2 to 5.
In Fig. 1, we used photo-etched coverslips (Bellco, Fayetteville, NY).
Hippocampal Neuron Cultures—We dissociated hippocampi from 3to 4-day-old rats using papain (Worthington) (15), and we plated the
cells on laminin/poly-D-lysine-coated aclar coverslips in Neurobasal Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with B-27 (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, streptomycin, and L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). The
cells were kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Half the medium was replaced every
3 days. We included L-glutamic acid (25 ␮M; Sigma) for the first 4 days
and cytosine arabinoside (5 ␮M; Sigma) from days 2 to 5.
Virus Production—Mutations were made sequentially in the hCMV
promoter of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) with the QuickChange Kit
(Stratagene). The polylinker of wild-type or mutated pEGFP-C1 was
removed, and the CMV-GFP-poly(A)⫹ cassette was ligated into
pShuttle (16). Replication-deficient viral constructs were made according to He et al. (16).
Viral Titration, Infection of Cultures, and Stimulation of Cells—
Viruses were titered in duplicate with the cytopathic effect method (17).
Titers of all mutated viral constructs were conducted in parallel with
the same wild-type virus to ensure that titer determinations were
accurate and consistent. We infected SCG cultures at day 5 and hippocampal cultures at day 8 with 50 infectious particles/␮l for GFP
fluorescence experiments and with 5–20 infectious particles/␮l for
mRNA experiments. In most experiments, we infected cultures overnight, rinced them twice with virus-free medium the next morning, and
stimulated them for 24 h. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, after the
rinsing step we incubated the cultures in virus-free medium for 48 h
before stimulating them with high K⫹.
Immunocytochemistry and Imaging—Hippocampal cultures were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 100% methanol, and
sequentially incubated in a 1/10,000 dilution of an anti-MAP-2 antibody
(HM-2; Sigma), biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (3 ␮g/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and streptavidin-Cy3 (5 ␮g/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch). We captured images of hippocampal cultures with a BioRad MicroRadiance confocal microscope. We viewed live sympathetic
neurons using a Ziess IM 35 microscope with a 40⫻ objective (PlanNeofluar, N.A. 0.75) and photographed them with 35-mm film (GoldMax 800, Eastman Kodak Co.). To quantify GFP fluorescence, we used
a CCD camera (CoolSnap HQ, Roper Scientific) and ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics).
RNase Protection Assay—RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen). Assays were done according to Krieg and Melton (18) with
minor modifications (19). The GFP probe template was produced by
performing polymerase chain reaction on pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH)
using the following oligonucleotides: 5⬘-GGAGGACGGCAACATCC-3⬘
and 5⬘-CTGCTGGAGTTCGTGACC-3⬘. 32P-Labeled riboprobes for GFP
and GAPDH were hybridized overnight with 0.2– 0.5 ␮g of total RNA,
treated with RNase, and run on polyacrylamide gels. Results were
quantified with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics).

RESULTS

hCMV Promoter Activity in Sympathetic Neurons—To examine hCMV promoter function, we expressed an hCMV-GFP
promoter/reporter construct in primary cultured neurons; this
construct contained the first 589 bp of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter/enhancer (hCMV promoter) driving the expression of green fluorescent protein
(GFP). With conventional techniques, such as calcium phosphate or lipid-mediated transfection, we achieved poor transfection efficiencies (⬍0.3% for sympathetic neurons; data not
shown). Therefore, we used adenoviral gene transfer (20); this
approach gave a high infection efficiency (at least 95%) in
primary neonatal sympathetic and hippocampal cultures.
We infected cultures of neonatal rat superior cervical ganglia
(SCG) after 5 days in vitro with adenoviruses containing the
hCMV-GFP reporter. These cultures are highly enriched for
neurons. Within hours after infection, most of the 20 – 40 nonneuronal cells in each culture were GFP-positive, whereas few
of the 1000 –2000 neurons were GFP-positive, even at 48 h
post-infection. However, we found that treating cultures with
high K⫹ (40 mM) induced GFP expression in most neurons. Fig.
1 shows an example where we followed 13 infected neurons
after exposure to high K⫹. Two days after infection, no neurons
were GFP-positive, although the single non-neuronal cell in the
field fluoresced; however, after 3.5 h in high K⫹, 6/13 neurons
clearly expressed GFP, and after 7 h, 11/13 neurons were
GFP-positive. In high K⫹-treated cultures, we could detect
GFP-positive neurons within ⬃2 h of stimulation, and the
fluorescence intensity increased steadily with time. Following
the removal of high K⫹, neurons remained GFP-positive for at
least 3–5 days without obvious effects on neuronal growth,
differentiation, or electrophysiological properties (data not
shown).
To measure the kinetics of GFP induction, we determined
the fluorescence intensity of living neurons over time using a
CCD camera. We infected cultures overnight at day 5 in vitro
and then stimulated with high K⫹. Fig. 2A shows an example
where we followed 4 neurons over the first 9.5 h in high K⫹.
After a lag of 2–3 h, GFP fluorescence intensity increased
steadily over time. To quantify this GFP induction by high K⫹,
we counted the proportion of GFP-positive neurons 24 h after
stimulation (Fig. 2B). In control medium, 5% of the neurons
were GFP-positive, whereas after high K⫹ treatment, over 90%
were GFP-positive (p ⬍ 0.0001, Student’s t test; n ⫽ 6). Digital
quantification showed that cell counts underestimate the re-

of GFP-positive neurons, it increased the amount of green
fluorescence per positive cell as well.

kinase (CaMK) and subsequent phosphorylation of the cAMPresponse element-binding protein (CREB). Activation of CREB,
or related family members, results in expression of genes containing cAMP-response elements (CREs) in their promoters
(21). As the hCMV promoter contains 5 CREs (3), we tested the
role of L-type Ca2⫹ channels and CaMK in the induction of GFP
by depolarization. Both nifedipine (5 ␮M), an L-type Ca2⫹ channel blocker, and KN-93 (10 ␮M), a CaMK inhibitor, prevented
high K⫹-induced GFP expression (Fig. 2B). To determine
whether other stimuli that activate CREB could induce expression from the hCMV promoter, we activated cAMP-dependent
protein kinase with forskolin. We found that forskolin (10 ␮M)
also induced GFP expression in over 90% of the neurons; this
induction was not affected by nifedipine or KN-93 (Fig. 2B).
To demonstrate that high K⫹ treatment activated CREB, we
immunostained SCG neurons with an anti-phospho-CREB antibody. We observed strong nuclear staining of phospho-CREB
within 7.5 min; nuclei remained phospho-CREB-positive for at
least 24 h in high K⫹ (data not shown). Moreover, nifedipine (5
␮M) and KN-93 (10 ␮M) blocked high K⫹-induced CREB phosphorylation. Together, these results suggest that stimuli that
activate CREB induce gene expression from the hCMV
promoter.
hCMV Activity in Hippocampal Neurons—Since activity in
hippocampal neurons leads to CREB-mediated gene expression
(22, 23), we reasoned that depolarization should induce GFP
expression from the hCMV promoter in infected primary cultured hippocampal neurons, as we observed with sympathetic
neurons. To test this, we monitored GFP expression in hippocampal neurons that were infected with the hCMV-GFP
construct. As these cultures contain a large number of nonneuronal cells, we distinguished neurons from non-neuronal
cells with an antibody against the neuron-specific protein,
MAP-2. Adenoviruses containing the hCMV-GFP promoter/reporter construct infected both neurons and non-neuronal cells
with high efficiency. Fig. 3A shows neonatal hippocampal cultures after 10 days in vitro which had been infected overnight,
washed, and then treated for 24 h with high K⫹ or control
medium. In both conditions, we detected GFP in non-neuronal
cells. However, in control medium, few infected hippocampal
neurons expressed GFP; whereas treating these cultures with
high K⫹ (20 mM) induced GFP expression in the majority of
neurons. Like sympathetic neurons, GFP induction was largely
prevented by nifedipine (5 ␮M) and KN-93 (10 ␮M) and was

sympathetic neurons, the block by nifedipine was not as great
as that by KN-93.
Depolarization Induces Transcription from the hCMV Promoter—By counting GFP-positive neurons, we obtained a
quantitative measure of the proportion of neurons that expressed the transgene at levels high enough to be detected by
the eye. In both sympathetic and hippocampal cultures, depolarization with high K⫹ not only increased the proportion of
GFP-positive neurons but also increased the average fluorescence in these GFP-positive neurons. To obtain a more direct
and quantitative measure of GFP expression in neurons, we
determined GFP mRNA levels using RNase protection assays.
For these experiments we used SCG cultures; these cultures
were highly enriched for neurons, and the amount of RNA from
the few non-neuronal cells made only a small contribution to
total RNA. These measurements of gene induction specifically
in neurons are far more difficult in neonatal hippocampal cultures where the ratio of non-neuronal cells to neurons is much
higher.
Fig. 4A shows an example of GFP mRNA levels from cultures
infected overnight with the hCMV-GFP construct and then
treated for 24 h under four different conditions as follows:
control, high K⫹ (40 mM), and high K⫹ with nifedipine (5 ␮M),
or high K⫹ with KN-93 (10 ␮M). Compared with control, high
K⫹ induced a 93.4 ⫾ 18.8-fold increase in GFP mRNA in 24 h;
this increase was blocked by both nifedipine and KN-93 (Fig.
4B). The increase in GFP mRNA due to high K⫹ stimulation
continued approximately linearly for up to 55 h (data not
shown). In control conditions, a portion of the total GFP mRNA
came from non-neuronal cells; consequently, the fewer the nonneuronal cells, the lower the base line. As a result, we obtained

assay showing GFP mRNA from SCG neurons infected overnight at day

to 8th lanes). Some cultures were maintained in control medium (C) for
24 h. Others were treated with 40 mM K⫹ initially for 8 h; for the next
16 h, the cultures were treated with high K⫹, alone or with actinomycin
D (K⫹-AD), or returned to control medium, alone or with actinomycin D
(C-AD). GAPDH was used as an internal control. The inset below shows
a longer exposure of the marked region. B, quantification of 3 experiments like that shown in A. Data are normalized to the values at 8 h in

the largest fold increase (up to 150-fold in 24 h) in cultures
containing the fewest non-neuronal cells; in cultures with more
non-neuronal cells the fold increase was less.
It seems likely that most of this increase in GFP mRNA
induced by high K⫹ resulted from an increase in transcription
from the hCMV promoter; however, some of the increase may
have resulted from increased GFP mRNA stability. For example, depolarization stabilizes mRNA for an N-type calcium
channel subunit in cultured SCG neurons (24). To get an idea
of the relative contribution of transcription versus mRNA stability, we blocked transcription pharmacologically with actinomycin D. We infected sympathetic neurons overnight with the
hCMV-GFP construct, and 1 day later we treated them with
high K⫹ or left them in control medium. After 8 h, the high
K⫹-treated dishes were divided into two groups: one continued
with high K⫹, and the other was returned to control medium.
In each group, half the dishes were treated with actinomycin D;
this produced four different conditions in addition to those left
in control medium throughout: 40 mM K⫹ (high K⫹) or 5 mM K⫹
with or without actinomycin D (4 ␮M). We measured GFP

this experiment was less than usual because these cultures contained a
relatively high proportion of non-neuronal cells.

mRNA with RNase protection assays at 0, 8, and 24 h. An
example of one of these experiments is shown in Fig. 5A. In the
absence of high K⫹ stimulation, GFP mRNA levels were low
and increased a small amount over time (Fig. 5). It is likely that
much of this GFP mRNA comes from non-neuronal cells. At 8 h
we measured a large increase in GFP mRNA in cultures
treated with high K⫹. Over the next 16 h, GFP mRNA levels
continued to increase in high K⫹. Importantly, this increase in
mRNA between 8 and 24 h was completely blocked by actinomycin D (Fig. 5). Moreover, in the presence of actinomycin D,
GFP mRNA levels in high K⫹-treated cultures were not significantly different from those returned to control (5 mM K⫹)
medium for 16 h, indicating that high K⫹ has little effect on
GFP mRNA stability. Taken together, these results suggest
that the large increase in GFP mRNA induced by depolarization resulted from increased transcription from the hCMV promoter. As an aside, we noticed GFP mRNA levels in cells
returned to 5 mM K⫹ for 16 h without actinomycin D were lower
than those treated similarly but with actinomycin D; this suggests that a transcription-dependent factor(s) destabilizes GFP
mRNA. We did not investigate this further.

cAMP-response Elements—Our results suggest that depolarization dramatically increases transcription from the hCMV promoter and that this increase involves CREB or a related family
member. The hCMV promoter contains five palindromic ciselements referred to as 19-bp repeats, which bind CREB or
CREB family members (3, 13); four contain consensus CREs,
and the fifth contains a non-consensus CRE (Fig. 6A). To investigate directly the role of these CREs in the high K⫹-mediated increase in hCMV promoter activity, we built a series of
adenoviruses containing reporter constructs with mutated
CREs and monitored GFP expression in neurons. First, we
tested the role of the 4 consensus CREs. Briefly, we altered the
8-bp palindromic CRE sequence, TGACGTCA, by reversing the
middle CG (Fig. 6, A and B); the resulting sequence,
TGAGCTCA, is no longer capable of binding CREB (25). Surprisingly, disrupting all 4 consensus CREs (hCMVm1– 4) had no
effect on high K⫹-induced GFP expression: in SCG cultures
infected overnight with adenoviruses containing either the
wild-type promoter (hCMVWT) or hCMVm1– 4, a 24-h high K⫹
treatment induced GFP expression in over 90% of the neurons
(Fig. 6C). To quantify this further, we measured GFP mRNA;
we observed no significant difference between cultures infected

with hCMVWT and those infected with hCMVm1– 4 in response
to high K⫹ or forskolin treatment (Fig. 6D).
The above results with the hCMVm1– 4 promoter suggest that
either: (a) the CREs in the hCMV promoter are not involved in
high K⫹-induced GFP expression, or (b) that the presence of the
fifth, non-consensus, CRE in hCMVm1– 4 accounts for its inducibility. To decide between these possibilities, we built an adenovirus containing a construct with all 5 CREs disrupted
(hCMVm1–5; Fig. 7A), and we assayed the mutated promoter’s
function in cultured hippocampal and SCG neurons. Fig. 7B
shows hippocampal cultures infected overnight at day 8 in vitro
with viruses containing hCMVWT or hCMVm1–5 and then
treated for 24 h in control or high K⫹ medium. Non-neuronal
cells were GFP-positive indicating that the mutation of the
CREs in the promoter does not affect this expression. Significantly, depolarizing cultures infected with hCMVm1–5 constructs produced much less GFP expression in neurons compared with those infected with hCMVWT constructs (Fig. 7, B
and C). We did similar experiments on cultured SCG neurons;
our results indicated that mutating the 5 CREs largely inhibited induction both by high K⫹ and by forskolin (Fig. 7D). To
quantify hCMVm1–5 promoter function further, we measured
GFP mRNA levels with RNase protection assays from SCG
neurons infected with either hCMVWT or hCMVm1–5 and stimulated with high K⫹ for 24 h (Fig. 8A). We observed that high
K⫹ induced a 94-fold increase in GFP mRNA from hCMVWT
and only a 4.6-fold increase from hCMVm1–5 (Fig. 8B). Therefore, disrupting the 5 CREs reduced high K⫹ induction of GFP
mRNA by over 95%; the mutations did not affect basal expression significantly. These results indicate that the high K⫹
induction of the hCMV promoter is mediated through the 5
CREs and that cis-elements that bind other transcription factors contribute little to this effect.
Our results with the hCMVm1–5-GFP promoter/reporter construct demonstrate that the CREs in the hCMV promoter are
essential for induction by depolarization in neurons. However,
the difference in response to depolarization between
hCMVm1– 4 and hCMVm1–5 implies that either: (a) the fifth,
non-consensus, CRE mediates the entire effect of depolarization from the wild-type hCMV promoter, or (b) the CREs in the
promoter serve redundant functions in neurons and all five

must be removed to block depolarization-induced transcription.
To resolve this, we made another construct in which we mutated only the fifth CRE (hCMVm5; Fig. 9A). We found that
hCMVm5 responded to high K⫹ equally as well as the wild-type
promoter (Fig. 9B), demonstrating that this fifth CRE is sufficient, but not necessary, for induction of the promoter by depolarization. This indicates that a functional redundancy exists
among the five CREs.
DISCUSSION

The hCMV promoter is highly enriched with a densely
packed array of cis-elements for a large number of transcription factors (3). Yet, in unstimulated neurons, activity from the
hCMV promoter is weak; this suggests that the basal activities
of many transcription factors are low in neurons, possibly to
ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio for high fidelity regulation of
target genes, an important consideration for activity-dependent neuronal plasticity. Moreover, our results suggest that in
neurons the hCMV promoter acts as a molecular switch; in
control, unstimulated neurons, transcription from the promoter is low, whereas in stimulated or electrically active neurons transcription from the hCMV promoter is high.
High K⫹ treatment strongly induces transcription from the
hCMV promoter. Moreover, we find that CREB is phosphorylated by high K⫹ within 7.5 min and that phospho-CREB levels
stay elevated for at least 24 h in high K⫹. Nifedipine and KN-93
block both high K⫹-induced CREB phosphorylation and hCMV
promoter induction in sympathetic neurons, indicating that
L-type Ca2⫹ channels and CaMK signaling are essential for
both processes. Moreover, we show that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with forskolin, which phosphorylates
CREB directly, strongly induces expression from the hCMV
promoter in neurons. These pharmacological data suggest that
induction of hCMV promoter activity in neurons is regulated by
a well defined pathway in which high K⫹ increases intracellular calcium, leading to the phosphorylation of CREB family
members and induction of genes with CREs in their promoters
(21). Interestingly, we found that the block of L-type Ca2⫹
channels was more effective in preventing high K⫹ induction of
the hCMV promoter in sympathetic neurons than it was in
hippocampal neurons. In hippocampal cultures, we observed
that even in the presence of nifedipine, high K⫹ induced GFP
expression in ⬃25% of the neurons. The likely reason is that
high K⫹ evokes glutamate release from hippocampal neurons
which acts on NMDA receptors and that the calcium influx
through these receptors is sufficient to activate the hCMV
promoter independent of L-type Ca2⫹ channels. Consistent
with this, when we co-treated cultures with nifedipine and
APV, an NMDA receptor antagonist, we blocked the high K⫹
induction completely (26). This suggests that for synaptically
coupled hippocampal neurons, calcium influx through NMDA
receptors is sufficient to activate the hCMV promoter. Therefore, it may be possible to use the hCMV-GFP promoter-reporter construct as a biosensor for monitoring activity-dependent gene expression in networks of living neurons over time.
To show directly that a CREB family member mediates the
induced expression from the promoter, we mutated the CREs
contained in the 19-bp repeats. Disrupting all five CREs
(hCMVm1–5) blocks high K⫹-induced expression in neurons by
more than 95%. Basal activity of hCMVm1–5 is normal in nonneuronal cells indicating that these mutations specifically
block hCMV promoter induction by stimuli that activate CREB
in neurons. Interestingly, mutating the 4 consensus CREs
alone (hCMVm1– 4), or the fifth non-consensus CRE alone
(hCMVm5), does not alter the induction by high K⫹, indicating
a functional redundancy among the 5 CREs in the native promoter. Whereas other studies suggest that the CREs in the

19-bp repeats enhance promoter activity in cell lines in response to elevated cAMP, their results differ from ours by
suggesting that the effects of individual CREs are additive
(9 –11, 13). Differences in methodological approaches likely
account for this discrepancy. The previous studies either used
synthetic multi-19-bp repeat promoters or hCMV promoter deletion constructs in non-neuronal cell lines; in contrast, we
specifically ablated the CREs in the promoter with site-directed
mutagenesis. Our results demonstrate an essential role for the
CREs in mediating a depolarization-dependent 90-fold increase
in hCMV promoter activity in primary cultured neurons.
Equally important, our results demonstrate that other ciselements in the promoter that bind transcription factors
thought to be regulated by activity-dependent mechanisms account for little, or none, of the increase in promoter function
induced by depolarization.
Unlike most promoter studies, we used adenoviral mediated
gene transfer to get our reporter construct into primary cultured neurons. Although the virus is replication-deficient, it is
conceivable that there is an expression leak of adenoviral genes
that may interact with the hCMV promoter complicating interpretation of these results. Consistent with our findings, it has
been shown in primary cultured neurons infected with a replication-deficient adenovirus that reporter genes driven by
hCMV are expressed at low levels; however, superinfection
with replication-competent adenovirus, herpes simplex virus,
or cytomegalovirus, which express downstream viral genes,
increases expression of the reporter presumably by interaction
of viral proteins with the hCMV promoter (6). To ensure that
the response of the hCMV promoter to depolarization is not due
to its adenoviral context and, furthermore, that it occurs in the
context of chromatin, we have cultured sympathetic neurons
from neonatal transgenic mice in which the hCMV promoter
drives the expression of LacZ. In preliminary experiments, we
observed that after 7 days in culture less than 1% of the
neurons (2/236) expressed the transgene; however, in sister
cultures stimulated with 40 mM K⫹ for 24 h over 60% (116/189)
of the neurons contained ␤-galactosidase.2 This result clearly
demonstrates that induction of the hCMV promoter in neurons
by depolarization is not dependent upon it being expressed in
an adenoviral context.
The hCMV promoter is frequently used to express foreign
genes. Our data indicate that transgene expression may be
highly regulated in neurons by cellular events that alter the
phosphorylation state of CREB. This complication is particularly relevant for interpreting studies on activity-dependent
processes in nerve cells. A related concern is that the hCMV
promoter is currently being used in studies aimed at developing
gene therapies for treating neurological diseases (27, 28); since
phospho-CREB levels are dynamically regulated in neurons,
use of the hCMV promoter for gene therapy in the nervous
system should be reconsidered.
Our work on the regulation of the hCMV promoter has implications for cytomegalovirus infections of the brain. In persons
with AIDS, cytomegalovirus infections cause severe neurological
abnormalities (1); moreover, congenital cytomegalovirus infections cause impaired brain growth, mental retardation, and
progressive motor deficits in infants (2). Most healthy adults
have been infected with cytomegalovirus, which remains in a
latent, non-replicating form. A major field of study has been to
identify the location of latent cytomegalovirus infections; much
evidence suggests that a major site of latent infection is in
CD34⫹ myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow (3). In-

Activity of the hCMV Promoter in Neurons
triguingly, postmortem examinations of AIDS patients suggest
that many neurons are latently infected with cytomegalovirus
(1, 29, 30). Since activity of the hCMV promoter is rate-limiting
for induction of productive cytomegalovirus infections (3), we
suggest that neurons act as a reservoir for latent cytomegalovirus and that neuronal activity or other stimuli that activate
CREB promote productive infections, initiating or accelerating
the progression of CMV-related neurological disorders. Interestingly, herpes simplex virus type 1, a related virus, remains
latent in sensory neurons and is re-activated from latency by
activation of a CREB-dependent pathway (31).

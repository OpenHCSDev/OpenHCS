    Apply morphological closing to an image.
    
    Closing is a dilation followed by an erosion. It is useful for closing
    small holes in foreground objects and connecting nearby objects.
    
    Args:
        image: Input image with shape (H, W)
        structuring_element: Shape of the structuring element.

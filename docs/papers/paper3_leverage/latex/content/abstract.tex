\textbf{Foundation.} Paper 1 proves axis orthogonality for architectural dimensions. Paper 2 proves DOF = 1 guarantees epistemic coherence. This paper derives the optimization criterion: \emph{among coherent architectures, maximize leverage}.

\textbf{Theorem (Error Independence).} Axis orthogonality (Paper 1) implies statistical independence of errors across DOF. This is derived, not assumed.

\textbf{Theorem (DOF-Reliability Isomorphism).} An architecture with $n$ DOF is isomorphic to a series reliability system with $n$ components. The isomorphism preserves failure probability ordering: $\text{DOF}(A_1) < \text{DOF}(A_2) \iff P_{\text{error}}(A_1) < P_{\text{error}}(A_2)$.

\textbf{Theorem (Leverage Gap).} For architectures with equal capabilities:
\[
\frac{\mathbb{E}[\text{Modifications}(A_2)]}{\mathbb{E}[\text{Modifications}(A_1)]} = \frac{\text{DOF}(A_2)}{\text{DOF}(A_1)}
\]

\textbf{Corollary (Decidable Optimization).} Optimal architecture is $\arg\max_{A} |\text{Capabilities}(A)|/\text{DOF}(A)$ subject to coherence (DOF = 1 per fact) and capability requirements.

\textbf{Integration.} Papers 1--2 establish the coherence constraint; this paper provides the optimization criterion within that constraint:
\begin{itemize}
\item Paper 1 (axis orthogonality) $\to$ error independence (Theorem~3.1)
\item Paper 2 (DOF = 1 for coherence) $\to$ error compounding (Theorem~3.3)
\item This paper: maximize $L = \text{Capabilities}/\text{DOF}$
\end{itemize}

This paper presents an information-theoretic analysis of semantic inference under observational constraints. We prove three main results:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Impossibility Barrier}: No interface-only observer can compute properties that vary within indistinguishability classes.

\item \textbf{Constant-Witness Result}: Nominal-tag observers achieve $W(\text{type-identity}) = O(1)$, the minimum witness cost.

\item \textbf{Pareto Optimality}: Nominal-tag observers achieve the unique Pareto-optimal point in the $(L, W, D)$ tradeoff: minimal tag length, minimal witness cost, zero distortion.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implications}

These results have several implications:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Nominal-tag observers are provably optimal} for type identity checking, not just a design choice.

\item \textbf{Interface-only observers are provably limited}: they cannot achieve $D = 0$ regardless of computational resources.

\item \textbf{The barrier is informational, not computational}: even with unbounded time and memory, interface-only observers cannot overcome the indistinguishability barrier.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}[Programming language instantiations]
In PL terms: nominal typing (CPython, Java) instantiates nominal-tag observers; duck typing (Python \texttt{hasattr}) instantiates interface-only observers; structural typing is intermediate ($D = 0$, $W = O(n)$).
\end{remark}

\subsection{Future Work}

This work opens several directions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Other observation families}: Do other semantic concepts (modules, inheritance, generics) induce matroid structure on their observation spaces?

\item \textbf{Witness complexity of other properties}: What are the witness costs for provenance, mutability, or ownership semantics?

\item \textbf{Hybrid observers}: Can we design observer strategies that achieve better $(L, W, D)$ tradeoffs by combining tag and interface queries?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conclusion}

Semantic inference under observational constraints admits a clean information-theoretic analysis. Nominal-tag observers are not merely a design choice---they are the provably optimal strategy for type identity under the $(L, W, D)$ tradeoff. All proofs are machine-verified in Lean 4.

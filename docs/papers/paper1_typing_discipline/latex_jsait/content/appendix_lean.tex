All theorems in this paper are formalized and machine-verified in Lean 4. The proofs are located in the repository at:

\texttt{docs/papers/paper1\_typing\_discipline/proofs/}

\subsection{Proof Statistics}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Total Lines}: \textasciitilde6,000
\item \textbf{Theorems}: 265
\item \textbf{Lemmas}: 150+
\item \textbf{Sorry Placeholders}: 0 (all proofs complete)
\item \textbf{Axioms Used}: propext (proposition extensionality)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Proof Files}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{abstract\_class\_system.lean}: Core formalization including matroid structure, witness complexity, and typing discipline comparisons
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
The proofs are consolidated in a single file for ease of verification. All theorems referenced in this paper (matroid structure, witness optimality, Pareto dominance) are contained therein.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Building the Proofs}

To verify the proofs locally:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cd docs/papers/paper1_typing_discipline/proofs
lake update
lake build
\end{lstlisting}

All theorems will be machine-verified if compilation succeeds with no errors.

\subsection{Axiom Dependencies}

The proofs use only one axiom: \texttt{propext} (proposition extensionality). This is a standard axiom in constructive mathematics and does not affect the validity of the results.

All other proofs are constructive (no use of \texttt{Classical.choice} or \texttt{Decidable.em}).

\subsection{Reproducibility}

The Lean toolchain version is specified in \texttt{lean-toolchain}. All dependencies are pinned in \texttt{lake-manifest.json}. The proofs are reproducible on any system with Lean 4 installed.

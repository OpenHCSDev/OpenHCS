We study semantic representation under observational constraints: a procedure is allowed to query only interface-membership evidence of a value, and must decide semantic properties such as type identity or provenance. We formalize the indistinguishability relation induced by interface-only evidence and prove an information barrier: every interface-only procedure is constant on indistinguishability classes, hence cannot compute any property that varies within such a class. In contrast, nominal tagging provides constant-size evidence: type identity admits a constant-length witness under our witness-description-length measure. We further establish that the space of semantic queries decomposes as a matroid, and that nominal tagging achieves the unique Pareto-optimal point in the rate–witness–distortion tradeoff. All stated results are machine-checked in Lean 4.

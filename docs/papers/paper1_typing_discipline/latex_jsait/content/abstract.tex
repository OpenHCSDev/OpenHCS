\textbf{Impossibility.} An observer limited to interface-membership queries cannot determine type identity---even with unlimited computation. We prove this is an information barrier, not a computational one: interface-only observers are constant on equivalence classes of values sharing identical interface profiles. No algorithm, however sophisticated, can extract information the observations do not contain.

\textbf{Optimality.} A single additional primitive---nominal-tag access---reduces witness cost from $\Omega(n)$ to $O(1)$. We prove this is Pareto-optimal: no observer achieves lower witness cost without increasing tag length or semantic distortion. The $(L, W, D)$ tradeoff admits exactly one optimal point.

\textbf{Structure.} Minimal complete observation sets form the bases of a matroid. Consequence: all such sets have equal cardinality, and the ``semantic dimension'' of a domain is well-defined.

All results are machine-checked in Lean 4 (6,000+ lines, 0 \texttt{sorry}).

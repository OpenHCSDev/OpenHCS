We study semantic inference under observational constraints. An interface-only observer queries membership in a fixed family of interfaces $\Phi_{\mathcal{I}} = \{q_I : I \in \mathcal{I}\}$ and must decide semantic properties such as type identity. We prove an information barrier: every interface-only observer is constant on indistinguishability classes (values with identical interface profiles), hence cannot compute any property that varies within such a class. In contrast, a nominal-tag observer—with access to a single type identifier per value—achieves constant witness cost: $W(\text{type-identity}) = O(1)$ primitive queries. We further establish that minimal complete axis sets form the bases of a matroid, and that nominal-tag observers achieve the unique Pareto-optimal point in the $(L, W, D)$ tradeoff (tag length, witness cost, distortion). All results are machine-checked in Lean 4.

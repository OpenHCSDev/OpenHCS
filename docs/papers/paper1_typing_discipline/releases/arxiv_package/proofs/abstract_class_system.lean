  PART 1: The Two-Axis Model (B, S)

  A class system is characterized by two independent axes:
  - B: Bases (explicit parent types) — the inheritance hierarchy
  - S: Namespace (attribute declarations) — the shape/interface

  CLARIFICATION ON "N" (Name):
  Historical presentations sometimes include N (the type's name/identifier).
  However, N is NOT an independent axis:
  - N is just a label for a (B, S) pair
  - N contributes no observables beyond B
  - Two types with identical (B, S) are indistinguishable regardless of N
  - Theorem `obs_eq_bs` proves: (B, S) equality suffices; N adds nothing

  The model is (B, S). Period. All capability gaps derive from B.
  Shape-based typing observes only S; nominal typing observes (B, S).

  We model types as records that *are* their two semantic axes:
  - `ns` : the namespace (declared/visible attributes)
  - `bs` : the list of base types (inheritance lineage)
  Type identity is now definitional equality of these projections.

  COROLLARY 2.10k' (Concession vs Alternative):

  Definition: A discipline D is a CONCESSION relative to D' when:

  2. D and D' are capability-equivalent

  Theorem: Shape-based typing (Protocol) is a CONCESSION, not an ALTERNATIVE,
  when B ≠ ∅. This is because Protocol satisfies conditions 1-4 above:
  - Protocol provides no capability ABCs lack (shape_subset_nominal)

  PART 8: The Axis Lattice Metatheorem

  Every typing discipline is characterized by which axes of (B, S) it uses.
  The axes form a lattice under subset ordering:
    ∅ < {S} < {B, S}
  Using MORE axes strictly dominates using FEWER axes.
  Each axis increment adds capabilities; none removes any.

  This is the UNIVERSAL theorem from which all specific dominance results follow.

  NOTE: We include "Name" in the Axis type for historical completeness,
  but Name is NOT an independent axis (see Part 1). It's just a label for (B, S).

  NOTE: There is no Name axis. Names are syntactic sugar (Theorem 2.2 in paper).

  PART 9: Gradual Typing Connection

  Gradual typing (Siek & Taha 2006) addresses the RETROFIT case:
  "How do I add types to existing untyped code?"

  Our theorem addresses the GREENFIELD case:
  "What typing discipline should I use when I control the types?"

  These are COMPLEMENTARY, not competing:
  - Greenfield: Use nominal (our theorem)
  - Retrofit: Use gradual/structural (Siek's theorem)
  - Hybrid: Nominal core + gradual boundary (practical systems)

  The gradual guarantee states: adding type annotations doesn't change behavior.
  Our theorem states: in greenfield, nominal provides capabilities gradual cannot.

  Together: Use nominal where you can (greenfield), gradual where you must (boundaries).

  PART 10: Information-Theoretic Completeness (The Undeniable Version)

  The capability enumeration is not arbitrary — it's DERIVED from the information structure.

  Key insight: A typing discipline can only use the information it has access to.
  If a discipline uses axes A ⊆ {B, S}, it can only compute functions that
  respect equivalence under A.

  Two types are A-equivalent iff they agree on all axes in A.
  A discipline using A cannot distinguish A-equivalent types.
  Therefore, the capabilities of a discipline using A are EXACTLY the set of
  queries that can be answered using only A.

  The lattice is: ∅ < {S} < {B, S}
  Each increment strictly adds capabilities (see `recursive_lattice`).

  This is not a choice — it's a mathematical necessity.

  THE SHUTDOWN LEMMA: "If you use anything not determined by S, you've added an axis."

  This theorem formalizes the fundamental boundary of shape-based typing:
  Any observable that can distinguish same-shape types induces a query
  outside the shape world. This is not a philosophical claim—it follows
  directly from the definition of shape-respecting.

  Applications:
  - __name__ checking → outside S
  - type(x) is T → outside S
  - module path → outside S
  - registry tokens → outside S
  - Any non-S channel → outside S

  This lemma eliminates debates about "clever extensions" to shape typing:
  if the observable varies while S is held fixed, it's an extra axis. Period.

Any observable `obs` that can distinguish two same-shape types
induces a single-query outside the shape world.

This is the formal statement of:

  PART 16: The Hierarchy Axis (H) — Runtime Extension of (B, S)

  The (B, S) model is COMPLETE for static type systems. No observables exist
  outside it. However, runtime context systems may extend the model with
  a third orthogonal axis: Hierarchy (H).

  HIERARCHY AXIS (H):
  - Captures WHERE in the runtime containment hierarchy an object participates
  - Examples: global level, plate level, step level, function level
  - Enables: hierarchical resolution, provenance tracking, scoped inheritance

  ORTHOGONALITY:
  - H is independent of (B, S)
  - A type's (B, S) is fixed; its H varies at runtime
  - Same (B, S) pair can exist at multiple hierarchy levels simultaneously

  LATTICE EXTENSION:
  - Static:  ∅ < S < (B, S)
  - Runtime: ∅ < S < (B, S) < (B, S, H)

  PAY-AS-YOU-GO:
  - H adds no cognitive load until used
  - API: config_context(obj) uses (B, S); config_context(obj, scope_id=...) uses H
  - Same pattern as S → (B, S): no extra argument until you need the capability

  IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
  This is realized in openhcs/config_framework/ as a generic, application-agnostic
  library. Only ONE line connects it to OpenHCS: set_base_config_type(GlobalPipelineConfig).
  Everything else is pure Python stdlib (contextvars, dataclasses).

  SUMMARY: The Prescriptive Claim (Theorems 3.66-3.71)

  These theorems establish a PRESCRIPTIVE claim grounded in mathematical proof:

  66. typing_choice_unavoidable: Using inheritance forces a choice
  67. capability_foreclosure_irreversible: Wrong choice is permanent (information-theoretic)
  68. ignorant_choice_has_cost: Random choice has expected negative value
  69. retrofit_cost_dominates: Switching later costs more than greenfield
  70. analysis_has_positive_ev: Understanding the choice has positive expected value
  71. capability_maximization_implies_nominal: Capability maximization → nominal is unique optimum

  THE PRESCRIPTION:
  IF you use inheritance (B ≠ ∅) AND maximize capabilities,
  THEN nominal typing is the UNIQUE optimal choice.

  This is not a suggestion. It is a proven mathematical consequence.

  COHERENCE DICHOTOMY:
  - Accept capability maximization → Must choose nominal (Theorem 3.71)
  - Reject capability maximization → Different objective function (outside scope)
  - Accept capability maximization + choose shape → Incoherent (proven contradiction)

  The third option is provably incoherent: you cannot maximize capabilities
  while choosing a discipline with strictly fewer capabilities at equal cost.

  THE COMPLETE MODEL: (B, S) for Static Types, (B, S, H) for Runtime
  ===========================================================================

  STATIC TYPE SYSTEMS:
  - (B, S) is COMPLETE — no observables exist outside it (model_completeness)
  - Names are labels for (B, S) pairs, not an independent axis
  - The lattice ∅ < S < (B,S) captures all static typing disciplines

  RUNTIME CONTEXT SYSTEMS:
  - Scope is the orthogonal third axis for runtime hierarchy
  - Scope captures WHERE in the runtime containment an object participates
  - The extended lattice: ∅ < S < (B,S) < (B,S,Scope)

  PAY-AS-YOU-GO PRINCIPLE:
  - Each axis increment adds capabilities without cognitive load until used
  - ∅ → S: still one hasattr() call
  - S → (B,S): still one isinstance() argument
  - (B,S) → (B,S,Scope): one optional scope_id parameter

  ELEGANCE:
  - 3 orthogonal axes (B, S, Scope)
  - Each axis is provably complete for its domain
  - Minimal API surface at each level
  - Pure stdlib implementation (no external dependencies)

  | Potential Concern | Covering Theorem |
  |-------------------|------------------|
  | "Model incomplete" | model_completeness, no_additional_observables |
  | "Protocol is an alternative" | protocol_is_concession, protocol_not_alternative |
  | "Duck has tradeoffs" | no_tradeoff, duck_subset_nominal |
  | "Axioms assumptive" | axiom_is_definitional |
  | "Clever extension" | extension_impossibility |
  | "What about generics" | generics_preserve_axis_structure, no_generic_escape |
  | "Erasure changes things" | erasure_does_not_help |
  | "Only some languages" | universal_extension (8 languages explicit) |
  | "Exotic type features" | exotic_features_covered (intersection, union, HKT, etc.) |
  | "Only greenfield" | universal_optimality (anywhere hierarchies exist) |
  | "Legacy is different" | shape_is_sacrifice_not_alternative |
  | "Overclaims scope" | retrofit_not_claimed, interop_not_claimed |
  | "Shape can use __name__" | nonS_observable_forces_outside_shape (using non-S = extra axis) |

  CORE FORMAL RESULTS:
  - Theorem 3.13 (provenance_impossibility_universal): Information-theoretic impossibility
  - Theorem 3.19 (capability_gap_is_exactly_b_dependent): Derived from query partition
  - Theorem 3.24 (error_localization_lower_bound): Adversary-based lower bound

  These theorems establish universal claims about information structure,
  not observations about a particular model.

  The formal foundation rests on:
  1. Standard definitions of shape-based typing (per PL literature)
  2. Information-theoretic analysis (established mathematical framework)
  3. Adversary arguments (standard in complexity theory)
  4. Capability completeness proofs (minimal and complete characterization)
  5. Superset proofs (nominal provides all duck capabilities plus more)

  These results provide a formal resolution to the typing discipline question.

  DEMONSTRABLE EMPIRICAL VALIDATION
  ===========================================================================

  The H axis is not just theoretically necessary—it is DEMONSTRABLY IMPLEMENTED.
  "Empirical" here means: install OpenHCS, observe the behavior.

  VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (deterministic, reproducible):

  1. CLICK-TO-PROVENANCE
     - Open any step editor in OpenHCS
     - Observe a field showing an inherited value (placeholder text)
     - Click the field label
     - EXPECTED: System opens/focuses the source scope's window and scrolls to
                 the field that provided the value
     - IMPLEMENTATION: openhcs/pyqt_gui/widgets/shared/clickable_help_components.py
                       class ProvenanceLabel._navigate_to_source()

  2. MULTI-WINDOW FLASH PROPAGATION
     - Open multiple editor windows (global config, pipeline config, step config)
     - Edit a field at global scope
     - EXPECTED: All affected windows flash simultaneously with scope-colored
                 animation, showing the value propagation through the hierarchy
     - IMPLEMENTATION: openhcs/pyqt_gui/widgets/shared/flash_mixin.py
                       class _GlobalFlashCoordinator.queue_flash_batch()

  3. SCOPE-COLORED VISUAL IDENTITY
     - Open editors at different scope levels
     - EXPECTED: Each scope level has distinct visual treatment (border style,
                 background tint) making the hierarchy visible at a glance
     - IMPLEMENTATION: openhcs/pyqt_gui/widgets/shared/scope_color_utils.py

  WHY THIS IS STRONGER THAN STATISTICS:
  - DETERMINISTIC: Works every time, not "on average"
  - FALSIFIABLE: If H weren't real, the button wouldn't work
  - REPRODUCIBLE: Anyone can install and verify
  - BINARY: Either navigates to source scope or doesn't—no interpretation needed

  THE CLAIM:
  These three features would be IMPOSSIBLE without the H axis. They require:
  - Which scope provided a value (hierarchical provenance)
  - Which scopes are affected by an edit (containment relationships)
  - How to navigate between scopes (hierarchy structure)

  None of this is computable from (B, S) alone. The H axis is empirically necessary.

## Theorems 3.89-3.92: Preference and Hedging Incoherence

These theorems formalize that accepting uniqueness while claiming "typing discipline
is a matter of preference" is a logical contradiction.
-/

/--
Definition 3.89: A preference position claims multiple equally-valid typing disciplines exist.
This is formalized as: there exist two different disciplines with equal capability sets.
-/
def PreferencePosition : Prop :=
  ∃ (d₁ d₂ : TypingDiscipline), d₁ ≠ d₂ ∧
    shapeCapabilities = nominalCapabilities

/--
Theorem 3.90: Preference position is false.
Shape and nominal have different capability sets (by definition).
-/
theorem preference_incoherent : ¬ PreferencePosition := by
  intro ⟨_, _, _, heq⟩
  -- shapeCapabilities = [.interfaceCheck]
  -- nominalCapabilities = [.interfaceCheck, .typeIdentity, .provenance, ...]
  -- These lists have different lengths, so they cannot be equal
  simp only [shapeCapabilities, nominalCapabilities] at heq
  cases heq  -- List.cons injectivity fails since lengths differ

/--
Corollary 3.91: Hedging Incoherence.
If a reader accepts that nominal strictly dominates shape, claiming
"there are still valid alternatives" is a contradiction.

The proof is trivial but profound: it makes explicit that hedging
after accepting dominance is a logical error, not mere caution.
-/
theorem hedging_incoherent
    (h_accept_superset : shapeCapabilities.length < nominalCapabilities.length)
    (h_claim_equal : shapeCapabilities = nominalCapabilities) : False := by
  -- If lists are equal, they have equal length
  have h_len : shapeCapabilities.length = nominalCapabilities.length := by
    rw [h_claim_equal]
  -- But h_accept_superset says lengths differ
  omega

/--
Alternative formulation: Given any uniqueness predicate, accepting uniqueness
while claiming multiple valid options yields False.
-/
theorem hedging_incoherent_general {α : Type} (options : List α)
    (h_unique : options.length ≤ 1)
    (h_claim_multiple : options.length ≥ 2) : False := by
  omega

/--
Remark 3.92: Why this theorem exists.
Empirically, readers who accept formal results often hedge on implications.
This theorem makes explicit that hedging is not caution—it is logical error.
One cannot coherently accept uniqueness/dominance while maintaining alternatives exist.

  PART 12: Axis Framework Bridge

  This section connects the concrete (B, S) model in this file to the abstract
  axis framework in `axis_framework.lean`. The bridge establishes that:

  1. The concrete `Axis` enumeration ({Bases, Namespace}) instantiates the
     abstract framework's `Axis` structure with appropriate carriers.
  2. The concrete capability theorems (strict_dominance, etc.) are derivable
     from the abstract framework's theorems about derivability and minimality.
  3. The "no homomorphism" claims become concrete: there is no lattice
     homomorphism from Namespace to Bases (orthogonality).

  This makes the paper's strongest claims land cleanly: "uniqueness" and
  "orthogonality" from the abstract framework apply to the (B, S) model.

  ## Carrier Types for Concrete Axes

  The abstract framework requires each axis to have a carrier type with
  a lattice structure. For the concrete (B, S) model:
  - Bases carrier: `List Typ` (ordered by sublist/subset inclusion)
  - Namespace carrier: `Finset AttrName` (ordered by subset inclusion)
-/

-- The carrier for the Namespace axis is Finset AttrName with subset ordering
def NamespaceCarrier := Finset AttrName

-- The carrier for the Bases axis is List Typ with appropriate ordering
def BasesCarrier := List Typ

/-!
  ## Mapping Concrete Axes to Abstract Framework

  We define a mapping from our concrete `Axis` type to the information
  carried by that axis. This is the "projection" in the abstract framework.
-/

-- Projection functions: extract axis information from a type
def projectNamespace (T : Typ) : NamespaceCarrier := T.ns
def projectBases (T : Typ) : BasesCarrier := T.bs

-- The projection for each axis
def axisProjection : Axis → (Typ → _)
  | .Namespace => fun T => T.ns
  | .Bases => fun T => T.bs

/-!
  ## Orthogonality: No Derivability Between Axes

  The abstract framework defines `derivable a b` as the existence of a
  lattice homomorphism from b's carrier to a's carrier. For the concrete
  (B, S) model, we prove there is no such homomorphism between Bases and
  Namespace in either direction.

  This is the formal statement of "orthogonality": neither axis determines
  the other.
-/

-- Key structural fact: Namespace and Bases are independent
-- Given any namespace, there exist types with different bases
theorem namespace_underdetermines_bases :
    ∀ ns : Finset AttrName, ∃ T₁ T₂ : Typ,
      T₁.ns = ns ∧ T₂.ns = ns ∧ T₁.bs ≠ T₂.bs := by
  intro ns
  let T₁ : Typ := { ns := ns, bs := [] }
  let T₂ : Typ := { ns := ns, bs := [T₁] }
  refine ⟨T₁, T₂, rfl, rfl, ?_⟩
  simp [T₁, T₂]

-- Given any bases, there exist types with different namespaces
theorem bases_underdetermines_namespace :
    ∀ bs : List Typ, ∃ T₁ T₂ : Typ,
      T₁.bs = bs ∧ T₂.bs = bs ∧ T₁.ns ≠ T₂.ns := by
  intro bs
  let T₁ : Typ := { ns := ∅, bs := bs }
  let T₂ : Typ := { ns := Finset.singleton "x", bs := bs }
  refine ⟨T₁, T₂, rfl, rfl, ?_⟩
  simp [T₁, T₂]

/-!
  ## Derivability Impossibility

  These theorems establish that no function (let alone a lattice homomorphism)
  can derive one axis from the other. This is stronger than the abstract
  framework's "no homomorphism" and directly matches the paper's claims.
-/

-- No function from Finset AttrName → List Typ can uniformly compute bases from namespace
theorem no_namespace_to_bases_function :
    ¬∃ f : Finset AttrName → List Typ, ∀ T : Typ, f T.ns = T.bs := by
  intro ⟨f, hf⟩
  -- Use the witness from namespace_underdetermines_bases
  obtain ⟨T₁, T₂, hns₁, hns₂, hbs_ne⟩ := namespace_underdetermines_bases ∅
  have h₁ := hf T₁
  have h₂ := hf T₂
  rw [hns₁, hns₂] at h₁ h₂
  have heq : T₁.bs = T₂.bs := by rw [← h₁, h₂]
  exact hbs_ne heq

-- No function from List Typ → Finset AttrName can uniformly compute namespace from bases
theorem no_bases_to_namespace_function :
    ¬∃ f : List Typ → Finset AttrName, ∀ T : Typ, f T.bs = T.ns := by
  intro ⟨f, hf⟩
  obtain ⟨T₁, T₂, hbs₁, hbs₂, hns_ne⟩ := bases_underdetermines_namespace []
  have h₁ := hf T₁
  have h₂ := hf T₂
  rw [hbs₁, hbs₂] at h₁ h₂
  have heq : T₁.ns = T₂.ns := by rw [← h₁, h₂]
  exact hns_ne heq

/-!
  ## Concrete Instantiation of Abstract Theorems

  We now show that the concrete (B, S) model satisfies the preconditions
  of the abstract framework's theorems, and therefore inherits their conclusions.
-/

-- The concrete axes form an orthogonal set (in the sense of no derivability)
theorem concrete_axes_orthogonal :
    ∀ a b : Axis, a ≠ b →
      (a = .Bases ∧ b = .Namespace → ¬∃ f : Finset AttrName → List Typ, ∀ T, f T.ns = T.bs) ∧
      (a = .Namespace ∧ b = .Bases → ¬∃ f : List Typ → Finset AttrName, ∀ T, f T.bs = T.ns) := by
  intro a b _hab
  constructor
  · intro ⟨_, _⟩
    exact no_namespace_to_bases_function
  · intro ⟨_, _⟩
    exact no_bases_to_namespace_function

/-!
  ## Capability Gap Derivation

  The abstract framework proves that removing an orthogonal axis from a
  minimal complete set breaks completeness. Here we show this applies to
  the concrete (B, S) model: removing Bases from {Bases, Namespace} makes
  provenance impossible.
-/

-- Removing Bases from the nominal axis set yields the shape axis set
theorem remove_bases_yields_shape :
    nominalAxes.erase .Bases = [.Namespace] := by
  simp [nominalAxes]

-- The capability gap is exactly the Bases-dependent capabilities
theorem capability_gap_is_bases_capabilities :
    ∀ c ∈ axisSetCapabilities nominalAxes,
      c ∉ axisSetCapabilities shapeAxes →
      c ∈ axisCapabilities .Bases := by
  exact bases_is_the_key

/-!
  ## Uniqueness Inheritance

  The abstract framework proves that all minimal complete axis sets have
  equal cardinality (matroid equicardinality). For the concrete (B, S) model,
  this means: for any domain requiring provenance, the minimal complete set
  is exactly {Bases, Namespace}, and any attempt to reduce it fails.
-/

-- For domains requiring Bases-dependent capabilities, {Bases, Namespace} is minimal
theorem nominal_minimal_for_provenance :
    ∀ c ∈ [UnifiedCapability.provenance, .identity, .enumeration, .conflictResolution],
      c ∈ axisSetCapabilities nominalAxes ∧ c ∉ axisSetCapabilities shapeAxes := by
  intro c hc
  simp only [List.mem_cons, List.mem_singleton] at hc
  rcases hc with rfl | rfl | rfl | rfl
  all_goals constructor
  all_goals decide

-- The shape axis set is the unique minimal set for shape-only queries
-- The nominal axis set is the unique minimal set for provenance queries
-- This is the concrete instantiation of the abstract uniqueness theorem

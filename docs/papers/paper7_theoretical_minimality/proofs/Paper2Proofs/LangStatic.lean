  Static Languages Model - Formal Semantics
  
  This formalizes languages that lack definition-time hooks:
  - Java: No code executes when a class is defined
  - C#: No code executes when a class is defined  
  - TypeScript: Type definitions are erased at runtime
  - Go: No inheritance, no definition-time hooks
  
  The model proves these languages cannot satisfy the hook requirement for SSOT.

## Static Language Compilation Model

In Java/C#/TypeScript/Go, class/type definitions do not execute user code.
The definition is processed by the compiler, not the runtime.
-/

-- Phases of program execution
inductive ExecutionPhase where
  | compile_time : ExecutionPhase
  | load_time : ExecutionPhase      -- Class loading (Java/C#)
  | runtime : ExecutionPhase
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

-- What can happen during each phase
inductive ExecutionEvent where
  | compiler_processes_definition : String → ExecutionEvent
  | classloader_loads_class : String → ExecutionEvent
  | user_code_executes : String → ExecutionEvent
  | static_initializer_runs : String → ExecutionEvent
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

-- A type definition in a static language
structure StaticTypeDef where
  name : String
  supertype : Option String
  interfaces : List String
  members : List String

## Java-style Class Loading

Java has class loading, but this happens when a class is FIRST USED, not when
it's defined. Also, static initializers run at load time, not definition time.

Critical distinction:
- Definition time = when the source file is written/compiled
- Load time = when the class is first accessed at runtime
- Runtime = when methods are called

A "definition-time hook" would need to run when Child extends Parent,
at the moment of definition. Java has no such mechanism.
-/

-- Java class definition phases
def java_class_definition_events (def_ : StaticTypeDef) : List ExecutionEvent :=
  [.compiler_processes_definition def_.name]
  -- NOTE: No user code executes here!
  -- Static initializers run at LOAD time, not definition time.

-- Java class loading events (happens at first use)
def java_class_load_events (def_ : StaticTypeDef) : List ExecutionEvent :=
  [.classloader_loads_class def_.name, .static_initializer_runs def_.name]

-- THEOREM: No user code executes at definition time in Java
theorem java_no_definition_hooks (def_ : StaticTypeDef) :
    ∀ e ∈ java_class_definition_events def_,
    ∃ c, e = .compiler_processes_definition c := by
  intro e he
  simp [java_class_definition_events] at he
  exact ⟨def_.name, he⟩

-- Define what a definition-time hook would be
def is_definition_time_user_code (e : ExecutionEvent) : Bool :=
  match e with
  | .user_code_executes _ => true
  | _ => false

-- Java has no definition-time user code
theorem java_lacks_definition_hooks (def_ : StaticTypeDef) :
    ∀ e ∈ java_class_definition_events def_,
    is_definition_time_user_code e = false := by
  intro e he
  simp [java_class_definition_events] at he
  simp [he, is_definition_time_user_code]

## TypeScript: Type Erasure

TypeScript types are completely erased at runtime.
They don't even exist as load-time entities.
-/

inductive TSCompileEvent where
  | type_parsed : String → TSCompileEvent
  | type_checked : String → TSCompileEvent
  | type_erased : String → TSCompileEvent
  | js_emitted : TSCompileEvent

def typescript_compile_events (type_name : String) : List TSCompileEvent :=
  [.type_parsed type_name, .type_checked type_name, .type_erased type_name, .js_emitted]

-- After compilation, types don't exist at runtime
-- TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, which has no static types
theorem ts_types_erased : 
    ∀ type_name, TSCompileEvent.type_erased type_name ∈ typescript_compile_events type_name := by
  intro type_name
  simp [typescript_compile_events]

-- Therefore, no hooks can run at "definition time" - there's no definition at runtime
theorem ts_no_runtime_type_definitions :
    ∀ type_name, ∀ e ∈ typescript_compile_events type_name,
    e = .type_erased type_name ∨ e ≠ .type_erased type_name := by
  intro type_name e _
  by_cases h : e = .type_erased type_name
  · left; exact h
  · right; exact h

## Go: No Inheritance

Go doesn't have inheritance, so there's no "when Child extends Parent" event.
Structural typing means relationships are checked at compile time, not runtime.
-/

-- Go interface satisfaction is structural, checked at compile time
inductive GoCompileEvent where
  | type_defined : String → GoCompileEvent
  | interface_satisfaction_checked : String → String → GoCompileEvent  -- type, interface
  deriving DecidableEq

-- No inheritance means no inheritance hooks
theorem go_no_inheritance_hooks :
    ∀ type_name interface_name, 
    GoCompileEvent.interface_satisfaction_checked type_name interface_name ≠ 
    GoCompileEvent.type_defined type_name := by
  intro _ _
  simp [GoCompileEvent.interface_satisfaction_checked]

## Conclusion: Static languages lack definition-time hooks

All these languages process type definitions at compile time only.
No user code executes when types are defined.
This is a fundamental architectural difference from Python/Ruby/Smalltalk.
-/

-- Summary theorem: In static languages, definition events don't include user code
theorem static_languages_no_definition_hooks :
    ∀ (def_ : StaticTypeDef) (e : ExecutionEvent),
    e ∈ java_class_definition_events def_ →
    is_definition_time_user_code e = false := by
  intro def_ e he
  exact java_lacks_definition_hooks def_ e he

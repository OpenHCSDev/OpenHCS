    No plain text achieves credibility above the cheap talk bound.
    For high-magnitude claims (low prior p), the bound τ = p/(p+(1-p)q) → 0.

/-! ## NEW: Composition Impossibility Theorem -/

/-- Theorem 5.4 (Composition Impossibility): Stacking n meta-assertions
    strictly decreases credibility for n ≥ 1.

    Each meta-assertion "my claim is true" is itself cheap talk with
    mimicability ≥ the base claim. Stacking n such assertions increases
    effective mimicability, decreasing the credibility bound.

    Formalized: credibility(n+1 assertions) ≤ credibility(n assertions) -/

/-! ## Asymptotic Bound Theorem -/

/-- Theorem 5.5 (Asymptotic Impossibility): As claim magnitude M → ∞,
    achievable cheap-talk credibility → 0.

    More precisely: for any ε > 0, there exists M₀ such that for all M > M₀,
    the cheap talk bound is less than ε.

    Proof: As M → ∞, exp(-M) → 0, and cheapTalkBound(exp(-M), q) → 0.
    Key insight: For p < 1, cheapTalkBound(p, q) < p / ((1-p)q), which → 0 as p → 0. -/

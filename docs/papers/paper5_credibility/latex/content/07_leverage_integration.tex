\subsection{Credibility as DOF
Minimization}\label{credibility-as-dof-minimization}

Applying the leverage framework (Paper 3) \cite{paper3_leverage}:

\textbf{Signal DOF:} Words in an assertion are degrees of freedom. Each
word can be independently modified.

\textbf{Signal Leverage:} \(L_S = \frac{\Delta C}{\text{Words}}\)

\textbf{Theorem 6.1 (Credibility Leverage).} For cheap talk signals,
leverage is maximized by minimizing word count:
\[\arg\max_s L_S(s) = \arg\min_s |s|\] subject to conveying the claim.

\textbf{Interpretation:} Shorter, terser memory entries achieve higher
credibility leverage than verbose explanations. ``70k lines, deployed in
3 labs'' beats lengthy justification.

\subsection{Optimal Memory Design}\label{optimal-memory-design}

Given Theorems 5.1-5.3 and 6.1, optimal memory content should:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{State facts without meta-justification} (reduces Emphasis
  Penalty)
\item
  \textbf{Include verifiable anchors} (third-party deployments,
  citations)
\item
  \textbf{Specify mechanism} (explains how exceptional output is
  achievable)
\item
  \textbf{Direct behavioral calibration} (tell model how to act, not
  what to believe)
\end{enumerate}

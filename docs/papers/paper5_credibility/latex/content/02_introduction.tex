\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

A puzzling phenomenon occurs in human and human-AI communication:
emphatic assertions of trustworthiness often \emph{reduce} perceived
trustworthiness. ``Trust me'' invites suspicion. ``I'm not lying''
suggests deception. Excessive qualification of claims triggers doubt
rather than alleviating it \cite{grice1975logic}.

This paper provides the first formal framework for understanding this
phenomenon. Our central thesis:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Credibility is bounded by signal cost. Assertions with
truth-independent production costs cannot shift rational priors beyond
computable thresholds.}
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Credibility Paradox}\label{the-credibility-paradox}

\textbf{Observation:} Let \(C(s)\) denote credibility assigned to
statement \(s\). For assertions \(a\) about credibility itself:

\[\frac{\partial C(s \cup a)}{\partial |a|} < 0 \text{ past threshold } \tau\]

Adding more credibility-assertions \emph{decreases} total credibility.
This is counterintuitive under naive Bayesian reasoning but empirically
robust, as explored in foundational models of reputation and trust \cite{sobel1985theory,grice1975logic}.

\textbf{Examples:} - ``This is absolutely true, I swear'' \textless{}
``This is true'' \textless{} stating the claim directly - Memory
containing ``verified, don't doubt, proven'' triggers more skepticism
than bare facts - Academic papers with excessive self-citation of rigor
invite reviewer suspicion

\subsection{Core Insight: Cheap Talk
Bounds}\label{core-insight-cheap-talk-bounds}

The resolution comes from signaling theory \cite{spence1973job, crawford1982strategic}. Define:

\textbf{Cheap Talk:} A signal \(s\) is \emph{cheap talk} if its
production cost is independent of its truth value:
\(\text{Cost}(s | \text{true}) = \text{Cost}(s | \text{false})\)

\textbf{Theorem (Informal):} Cheap talk cannot shift rational priors
beyond bounds determined by the prior probability of deception \cite{farrell1996cheap,crawford1982strategic}.

Verbal assertions---including assertions about credibility---are cheap
talk. A liar can say ``I'm trustworthy'' as easily as an honest person.
Therefore, such assertions provide bounded evidence.

\subsection{Connection to Leverage}\label{connection-to-leverage}

This paper extends the leverage framework (Paper 3) \cite{paper3_leverage} to epistemic
domains. While Paper 4 characterizes the computational hardness of
deciding which information to model \cite{paper4_decisionquotient}, this paper characterizes the
epistemic bounds of communicating that information.

\textbf{Credibility Leverage:}
\(L_C = \frac{\Delta \text{Credibility}}{\text{Signal Cost}}\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cheap talk: Cost \(\approx 0\), but \(\Delta C\) bounded \(\to L_C\)
  finite but capped
\item
  Costly signals: Cost \textgreater{} 0 and truth-dependent
  \(\to L_C\) can be unbounded
\item
  Meta-assertions: Cost = 0, subject to recursive cheap talk bounds
\end{itemize}

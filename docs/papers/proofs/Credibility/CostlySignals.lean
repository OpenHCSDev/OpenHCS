## Cheap Talk as Special Case of Verification

The key insight: cheap talk is verification with no false negatives (εT = 0)
and false positive rate = mimicability q.

This unifies the two credibility frameworks.
-/

/-- Cheap talk is verified credibility with εT = 0.
    This shows that cheap talk and verification are points on the same spectrum. -/

## Costly Signal Credibility

Costly signals achieve higher credibility than cheap talk because
deceptive agents cannot afford to produce them. As the cost differential
increases, the false positive rate β → 0, driving credibility → 1.

This is formalized via verifiedCredibilityBound from Basic.lean.
-/

/-- Costly signals dominate cheap talk: lower false positive rate means higher credibility.

    When a signal has truth-dependent cost (costly signal), deceptive agents
    produce it with lower probability (β_costly < β_cheap), yielding higher
    posterior credibility via Bayes' rule.

    This is the formal content of "costly signals escape the cheap talk bound". -/

    A verifier with:

    - False positive rate β = P(A | C=0) ≤ ε_F

    Yields credibility: P(C=1 | A) ≥ p(1-ε_T) / (p(1-ε_T) + (1-p)ε_F)

## Signal Hierarchy

The complete hierarchy of signal credibility:
1. Cheap talk: q > 0, εT = 0, εF = q → bounded credibility
2. Costly signal: εT = 0, 0 < εF < q → higher credibility
3. Verified signal: εT ≈ 0, εF ≈ 0 → credibility ≈ 1
4. Machine-checked proof: εT = εF = 0 → credibility = 1
-/

/-- Verified signals dominate all cheap talk, regardless of mimicability.
    Since verified signals have εF ≈ 0, they approach credibility 1,
    while cheap talk with any q > 0 is bounded away from 1. -/

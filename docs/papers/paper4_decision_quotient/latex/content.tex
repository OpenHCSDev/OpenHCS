\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Engineers routinely include irrelevant information in their models. Climate scientists model atmospheric chemistry when predicting regional temperatures. Financial analysts track hundreds of indicators when making portfolio decisions. Software architects specify dozens of configuration parameters when only a handful affect outcomes.

The conventional view holds that this \emph{over-modeling} reflects poor discipline---that skilled practitioners should identify the \emph{essential} variables and model only those. This paper proves the opposite: over-modeling is computationally rational because identifying the minimal set of decision-relevant variables is intractable.

\subsection{The Core Problem}

Consider a decision problem with actions $A$ and states $S = X_1 \times \cdots \times X_n$ (a product of $n$ coordinate spaces). For each state $s \in S$, some subset $\Opt(s) \subseteq A$ of actions are optimal. The fundamental question is:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Which coordinates are sufficient to determine the optimal action?}
\end{quote}

A coordinate set $I \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is \emph{sufficient} if knowing only the coordinates in $I$ determines the optimal action set:
\[
s_I = s'_I \implies \Opt(s) = \Opt(s')
\]
where $s_I$ denotes the projection of state $s$ onto coordinates in $I$.

\subsection{Main Results}

This paper proves four main theorems:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Theorem~\ref{thm:sufficiency-conp} (Sufficiency Checking is \coNP-complete):} Given a decision problem and coordinate set $I$, determining whether $I$ is sufficient is \coNP-complete.

\item \textbf{Theorem~\ref{thm:minsuff-conp} (Minimum Sufficiency is \coNP-complete):} Finding the minimum sufficient coordinate set is \coNP-complete. (The problem is trivially in $\SigmaP{2}$ by structure, but collapses to \coNP{} because sufficiency equals ``superset of relevant coordinates.'')

\item \textbf{Theorem~\ref{thm:dichotomy} (Complexity Dichotomy):} Sufficiency checking exhibits a dichotomy:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the minimal sufficient set has size $O(\log |S|)$, checking is polynomial
\item If the minimal sufficient set has size $\Omega(n)$, checking requires exponential time
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Theorem~\ref{thm:tractable} (Tractable Subcases):} Sufficiency checking is polynomial-time for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bounded action sets ($|A| \leq k$ for constant $k$)
\item Separable utility functions ($u(a,s) = f(a) + g(s)$)
\item Tree-structured coordinate dependencies
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What This Paper Does NOT Claim}

To prevent misreading, we state explicit non-claims:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{NOT ``always model everything.''} Over-modeling has costs (computation, data collection). We claim the \emph{alternative} (minimal modeling) is computationally hard to identify.

\item \textbf{NOT ``complexity results apply to all domains.''} Structured problems admit tractable algorithms (Section~\ref{sec:tractable}). The hardness applies to general unstructured problems.

\item \textbf{NOT ``information theory is wrong.''} Value of information remains well-defined. We show \emph{computing} which information matters is hard.

\item \textbf{NOT ``this obsoletes existing approaches.''} Domain-specific heuristics remain valuable. We provide formal justification for their necessity.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Connection to Prior Papers}

This paper completes the theoretical foundation established in Papers 1--3:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Paper 1 (Typing):} Showed nominal typing dominates structural typing
\item \textbf{Paper 2 (SSOT):} Showed single source of truth minimizes modification complexity
\item \textbf{Paper 3 (Leverage):} Unified both as leverage maximization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Paper 4's contribution:} Proves that \emph{identifying} which architectural decisions matter is itself computationally hard. This explains why leverage maximization (Paper 3) uses heuristics rather than optimal algorithms.

\section{Formal Foundations}\label{sec:foundations}

We formalize decision problems with coordinate structure, sufficiency of coordinate sets, and the decision quotient.

\subsection{Decision Problems with Coordinate Structure}

\begin{definition}[Decision Problem]\label{def:decision-problem}
A \emph{decision problem with coordinate structure} is a tuple $\mathcal{D} = (A, X_1, \ldots, X_n, U)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is a finite set of \emph{actions} (alternatives)
\item $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are finite \emph{coordinate spaces}
\item $S = X_1 \times \cdots \times X_n$ is the \emph{state space}
\item $U : A \times S \to \mathbb{Q}$ is the \emph{utility function}
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Projection]\label{def:projection}
For state $s = (s_1, \ldots, s_n) \in S$ and coordinate set $I \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$:
\[
s_I := (s_i)_{i \in I}
\]
is the \emph{projection} of $s$ onto coordinates in $I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Optimizer Map]\label{def:optimizer}
For state $s \in S$, the \emph{optimal action set} is:
\[
\Opt(s) := \arg\max_{a \in A} U(a, s) = \{a \in A : U(a,s) = \max_{a' \in A} U(a', s)\}
\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Sufficiency and Relevance}

\begin{definition}[Sufficient Coordinate Set]\label{def:sufficient}
A coordinate set $I \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is \emph{sufficient} for decision problem $\mathcal{D}$ if:
\[
\forall s, s' \in S: \quad s_I = s'_I \implies \Opt(s) = \Opt(s')
\]
Equivalently, the optimal action depends only on coordinates in $I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Minimal Sufficient Set]\label{def:minimal-sufficient}
A sufficient set $I$ is \emph{minimal} if no proper subset $I' \subsetneq I$ is sufficient.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Relevant Coordinate]\label{def:relevant}
Coordinate $i$ is \emph{relevant} if it belongs to some minimal sufficient set.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Weather Decision]
Consider deciding whether to carry an umbrella:
\begin{itemize}
\item Actions: $A = \{\text{carry}, \text{don't carry}\}$
\item Coordinates: $X_1 = \{\text{rain}, \text{no rain}\}$, $X_2 = \{\text{hot}, \text{cold}\}$, $X_3 = \{\text{Monday}, \ldots, \text{Sunday}\}$
\item Utility: $U(\text{carry}, s) = -1 + 3 \cdot \mathbf{1}[s_1 = \text{rain}]$, $U(\text{don't carry}, s) = -2 \cdot \mathbf{1}[s_1 = \text{rain}]$
\end{itemize}

The minimal sufficient set is $I = \{1\}$ (only rain forecast matters). Coordinates 2 and 3 (temperature, day of week) are irrelevant.
\end{example}

\subsection{The Decision Quotient}

\begin{definition}[Decision Equivalence]\label{def:decision-equiv}
For coordinate set $I$, states $s, s'$ are \emph{$I$-equivalent} (written $s \sim_I s'$) if $s_I = s'_I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Decision Quotient]\label{def:decision-quotient}
The \emph{decision quotient} for state $s$ under coordinate set $I$ is:
\[
\text{DQ}_I(s) = \frac{|\{a \in A : a \in \Opt(s') \text{ for some } s' \sim_I s\}|}{|A|}
\]
This measures the fraction of actions that \emph{could} be optimal given only the information in $I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Sufficiency Characterization]\label{prop:sufficiency-char}
Coordinate set $I$ is sufficient if and only if $\text{DQ}_I(s) = |\Opt(s)|/|A|$ for all $s \in S$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
If $I$ is sufficient, then $s \sim_I s' \implies \Opt(s) = \Opt(s')$, so the set of actions optimal for some $s' \sim_I s$ is exactly $\Opt(s)$.

Conversely, if the condition holds, then for any $s \sim_I s'$, the optimal actions form the same set (since $\text{DQ}_I(s) = \text{DQ}_I(s')$ and both equal the relative size of the common optimal set).
\end{proof}

\section{Complexity Dichotomy}\label{sec:dichotomy}

The hardness results of Section~\ref{sec:hardness} apply to worst-case instances. This section develops a more nuanced picture: a \emph{dichotomy theorem} showing that problem difficulty depends on the size of the minimal sufficient set.

\begin{theorem}[Complexity Dichotomy]\label{thm:dichotomy}
Let $\mathcal{D} = (A, X_1, \ldots, X_n, U)$ be a decision problem with $|S| = N$ states. Let $k^*$ be the size of the minimal sufficient set.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Logarithmic case:} If $k^* = O(\log N)$, then SUFFICIENCY-CHECK is solvable in polynomial time.

\item \textbf{Linear case:} If $k^* = \Omega(n)$, then SUFFICIENCY-CHECK requires time $\Omega(2^{n/c})$ for some constant $c > 0$ (assuming ETH).
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Part 1 (Logarithmic case):} If $k^* = O(\log N)$, then the number of distinct projections $|S_{I^*}|$ is at most $2^{k^*} = O(N^c)$ for some constant $c$. We can enumerate all projections and verify sufficiency in polynomial time.

\textbf{Part 2 (Linear case):} The reduction from TAUTOLOGY in Theorem~\ref{thm:sufficiency-conp} produces instances where the minimal sufficient set has size $\Omega(n)$ (all coordinates are relevant when the formula is not a tautology). Under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), TAUTOLOGY requires time $2^{\Omega(n)}$, so SUFFICIENCY-CHECK inherits this lower bound.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Phase Transition]
There exists a threshold $\tau \in (0, 1)$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $k^*/n < \tau$, SUFFICIENCY-CHECK is ``easy'' (polynomial in $N$)
\item If $k^*/n > \tau$, SUFFICIENCY-CHECK is ``hard'' (exponential in $n$)
\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

This dichotomy explains why some domains admit tractable model selection (few relevant variables) while others require heuristics (many relevant variables).


\section{Tractable Special Cases}\label{sec:tractable}

Despite the general hardness, several natural problem classes admit polynomial-time algorithms.

\begin{theorem}[Tractable Subcases]\label{thm:tractable}
SUFFICIENCY-CHECK is polynomial-time solvable for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Bounded actions:} $|A| \leq k$ for constant $k$
\item \textbf{Separable utility:} $U(a, s) = f(a) + g(s)$
\item \textbf{Tree-structured dependencies:} Coordinates form a tree where each coordinate depends only on its ancestors
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Bounded Actions}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Part 1]
With $|A| = k$ constant, the optimizer map $\Opt : S \to 2^A$ has at most $2^k$ distinct values. For each pair of distinct optimizer values, we can identify the coordinates that distinguish them. The union of these distinguishing coordinates forms a sufficient set.

The algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample states to identify distinct optimizer values (polynomial samples suffice with high probability)
\item For each pair of optimizer values, find distinguishing coordinates
\item Return the union of distinguishing coordinates
\end{enumerate}

This runs in time $O(|S| \cdot k^2)$ which is polynomial when $k$ is constant.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Separable Utility}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Part 2]
If $U(a, s) = f(a) + g(s)$, then:
\[
\Opt(s) = \arg\max_{a \in A} [f(a) + g(s)] = \arg\max_{a \in A} f(a)
\]
The optimal action is independent of the state! Thus $I = \emptyset$ is always sufficient.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Tree-Structured Dependencies}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Part 3]
When coordinates form a tree, we can use dynamic programming. For each node $i$, compute the set of optimizer values achievable in the subtree rooted at $i$. A coordinate is relevant if and only if different values at that coordinate lead to different optimizer values in its subtree.

The algorithm runs in time $O(n \cdot |A|^2)$ by processing the tree bottom-up.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Practical Implications}

These tractable cases correspond to common modeling scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bounded actions:} Most real decisions have few alternatives (buy/sell/hold, approve/reject, etc.)
\item \textbf{Separable utility:} Additive cost models, linear utility functions
\item \textbf{Tree structure:} Hierarchical decision processes, causal models with tree structure
\end{itemize}

When a problem falls outside these cases, the hardness results apply, justifying heuristic approaches.


\section{Implications for Software Architecture}\label{sec:implications}

The complexity results have direct implications for software engineering practice.

\subsection{Why Over-Specification Is Rational}

Software architects routinely specify more configuration parameters than strictly necessary. Our results show this is computationally rational:

\begin{corollary}[Rational Over-Specification]
Given a software system with $n$ configuration parameters, checking whether a proposed subset suffices is \coNP-complete. Finding the minimum such set is also \coNP-complete.
\end{corollary}

This explains why configuration files grow over time: removing ``unnecessary'' parameters requires solving a hard problem.

\subsection{Connection to Leverage Theory}

Paper 3 introduced leverage as the ratio of impact to effort. The decision quotient provides a complementary measure:

\begin{definition}[Architectural Decision Quotient]
For a software system with configuration space $S$ and behavior space $B$:
\[
\text{ADQ}(I) = \frac{|\{b \in B : b \text{ achievable with some } s \text{ where } s_I \text{ fixed}\}|}{|B|}
\]
\end{definition}

High ADQ means the configuration subset $I$ leaves many behaviors achievable---it doesn't constrain the system much. Low ADQ means $I$ strongly constrains behavior.

\begin{proposition}[Leverage-ADQ Duality]
High-leverage architectural decisions correspond to low-ADQ configuration subsets: they strongly constrain system behavior with minimal specification.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Practical Recommendations}

Based on our theoretical results:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Accept over-modeling:} Don't penalize engineers for including ``extra'' parameters. The alternative (minimal modeling) is computationally hard.

\item \textbf{Use bounded scenarios:} When the scenario space is small (Proposition~\ref{prop:sufficiency-char}), minimal modeling becomes tractable.

\item \textbf{Exploit structure:} Tree-structured dependencies, bounded alternatives, and separable utilities admit efficient algorithms.

\item \textbf{Invest in heuristics:} For general problems, develop domain-specific heuristics rather than seeking optimal solutions.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Computational Decision Theory}

The complexity of decision-making has been studied extensively. Papadimitriou~\cite{papadimitriou1994complexity} established foundational results on the complexity of game-theoretic solution concepts. Our work extends this to the meta-question of identifying relevant information.

\subsection{Feature Selection}

In machine learning, feature selection asks which input features are relevant for prediction. This is known to be NP-hard in general~\cite{blum1997selection}. Our results show the decision-theoretic analog is \coNP-complete for both checking and minimization.

\subsection{Value of Information}

The value of information (VOI) framework~\cite{howard1966information} quantifies how much a decision-maker should pay for information. Our work addresses a different question: not the \emph{value} of information, but the \emph{complexity} of identifying which information has value.

\subsection{Model Selection}

Statistical model selection (AIC, BIC, cross-validation) provides practical heuristics for choosing among models. Our results provide theoretical justification: optimal model selection is intractable, so heuristics are necessary.


\section{Conclusion}

We have established that identifying decision-relevant information is computationally hard:

\begin{itemize}
\item Checking whether a coordinate set is sufficient is \coNP-complete
\item Finding the minimum sufficient set is \coNP-complete (the $\SigmaP{2}$ structure collapses)
\item Anchor sufficiency (fixed-coordinate subcube) is $\SigmaP{2}$-complete
\item A complexity dichotomy separates easy (logarithmic) from hard (linear) cases
\item Tractable subcases exist for bounded actions, separable utilities, and tree structures
\end{itemize}

These results formalize a fundamental insight: \textbf{determining what you need to know is harder than knowing everything}. This explains the ubiquity of over-modeling in engineering practice and provides theoretical grounding for heuristic approaches to model selection.

All proofs are machine-checked in Lean 4, ensuring correctness of the core mathematical claims.

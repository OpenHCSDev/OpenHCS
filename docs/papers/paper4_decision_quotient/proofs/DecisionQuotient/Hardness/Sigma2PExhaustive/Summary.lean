/-! # Σ₂ᴾ Exhaustive Summary

Result of the exhaustive attack on MSS Σ₂ᴾ-completeness:

## Vector Status

* **Vector A (size encoding):** Blocked. The size IS the relevant-set cardinality.
* **Vector B (non-Boolean):** Blocked. See `vectorB_blocked` below.
* **Vector C (ANCHOR lift):** Blocked. MSS is coNP; can't receive Σ₂ᴾ reduction.
* **Vector D (alt sources):** Blocked. Same reason as Vector C.
* **Vector E (coNP):** Success. MSS is coNP-complete.

## Key Obstruction

The theorem `sufficient_contains_relevant` (Sufficiency.lean, line 99) proves:
  For ANY ProductSpace (not just Boolean), any sufficient set must contain
  all relevant coordinates.

This is a purely logical consequence of the definitions and uses NO structure
of the coordinate types. The proof:
  1. Assume i ∉ I (sufficient set)
  2. Since i is relevant, ∃s,s' differing only at i with Opt(s) ≠ Opt(s')
  3. Since s,s' differ only at i and i ∉ I, they agree on I
  4. By sufficiency: Opt(s) = Opt(s'), contradicting step 2

## Resolution

MSS is coNP-complete under any ProductSpace model:
  - coNP-hardness: proven (reduction from UNSAT)
  - coNP membership: certificate for NO is k+1 relevant coords with witnesses

The Σ₂ᴾ-hardness results apply to ANCHOR-SUFFICIENCY (different problem).

/-- Vector B closure: the obstruction applies to ALL ProductSpaces, not just Bool.

The theorem `sufficient_contains_relevant` is proven in Sufficiency.lean for
arbitrary ProductSpace S n. It makes no assumption about coordinate types.

Therefore non-Boolean coordinates (Fin 3, etc.) do NOT escape the obstruction. -/
theorem vectorB_blocked : True := trivial
-- The actual theorem is `sufficient_contains_relevant` in Sufficiency.lean.
-- We reference it here to document that Vector B is closed.

#check @DecisionProblem.sufficient_contains_relevant
-- This has type:
-- ∀ {A S : Type*} {n : ℕ} [CoordinateSpace S n] (dp : DecisionProblem A S)
--   (I : Finset (Fin n)), dp.isSufficient I → ∀ i, dp.isRelevant i → i ∈ I
-- Note: CoordinateSpace, not just Boolean. The obstruction is universal.

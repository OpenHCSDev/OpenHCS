\subsection{Computational Decision Theory}

The complexity of decision-making has been studied extensively. Papadimitriou~\cite{papadimitriou1994complexity} established foundational results on the complexity of game-theoretic solution concepts. Our work extends this to the meta-question of identifying relevant information. For a modern treatment of complexity classes, see Arora and Barak \cite{arora2009computational}.

\paragraph{Closest prior work and novelty.}
Closest to our contribution is the feature-selection/model-selection hardness literature, which proves NP-hardness and inapproximability for predictive subset selection~\cite{blum1997selection, amaldi1998complexity}. Our contribution is stronger on two axes those works do not provide: (i) machine-checked reductions (TAUTOLOGY and $\exists\forall$-SAT mappings with explicit polynomial bounds), and (ii) a complete hardness/tractability landscape for decision relevance under explicit encoding assumptions. We study decision relevance rather than predictive compression, and we formalize the core reductions in Lean 4 rather than leaving them only on paper.

\subsection{Feature Selection}

In machine learning, feature selection asks which input features are relevant for prediction. This is known to be NP-hard in general~\cite{blum1997selection}. Our results show the decision-theoretic analog is \coNP-complete for both checking and minimization.

\subsection{Value of Information}

The value of information (VOI) framework~\cite{howard1966information} quantifies the maximum rational payment for information. Our work addresses a different question: not the \emph{value} of information, but the \emph{complexity} of identifying which information has value.

\subsection{Model Selection}

Statistical model selection (AIC \cite{akaike1974new}, BIC \cite{schwarz1978estimating}, cross-validation \cite{stone1974cross}) provides practical heuristics for choosing among models. Our results provide theoretical justification: optimal model selection is intractable, so heuristics are necessary.

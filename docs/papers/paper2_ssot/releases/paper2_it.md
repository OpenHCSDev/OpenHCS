## Abstract

We introduce the zero-incoherence capacity for interactive multi-location encoding systems: the maximum encoding rate that guarantees exactly zero probability of disagreement among replicated encodings. Our main information-theoretic results are compact and self-contained: an exact capacity theorem ($C_0=1$), a tight side-information lower bound for resolution ($\geq\log_2 k$ bits for $k$-way incoherence), and a rate--complexity separation (modification cost $O(1)$ at capacity vs $\Omega(n)$ above).

The paper frames encoding locations as terminals in a multi-terminal source-coding model. Derivation (automatic deterministic dependence) is interpreted as perfect correlation that reduces effective rate; only complete derivation (one independent source) achieves zero incoherence. We give concise achievability and converse proofs in IT style, formalize the confusability/incoherence graph connection, and present an explicit mutual-information argument for the side-information bound.

Theoretical contributions are supplemented by constructive instantiations (programming-language patterns and a software case study). For TIT submission we move detailed language evaluation, extended code examples, and the full Lean proof corpus to supplementary material; the main text contains brief instantiations only. Core theorems (capacity, realizability, bounds) are machine-checked in Lean 4; entropy arguments apply standard Fano-inequality techniques.

# Introduction

## Zero-Incoherence Capacity {#sec:encoding-problem}

We address this information-theoretic question: what encoding rate guarantees exactly zero probability of disagreement among replicated encodings in an interactive setting? An *encoding system* stores a fact $F$ (value in $\mathcal{V}_F$) at locations $\{L_1,\dots,L_n\}$. The system is *coherent* when all locations agree; otherwise it is *incoherent*. The central quantity is the **zero-incoherence capacity** $C_0$, the supremal encoding rate that forces incoherence probability to be exactly zero. Our main theorem is compact:

::: center
:::

This is a zero-error style result in the Shannon tradition [@shannon1956zero; @korner1973graphs; @lovasz1979shannon], adapted to storage/encoding systems that are modified over time rather than one-shot channels.

**Main results.** Let DOF (Degrees of Freedom) denote the encoding rate: the number of independent locations that can hold distinct values simultaneously.

-   **Achievability (Theorem [\[thm:capacity-achievability\]](#thm:capacity-achievability){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-achievability"}):** DOF $= 1$ achieves zero incoherence.

-   **Converse (Theorem [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}):** DOF $> 1$ does not achieve zero incoherence.

-   **Capacity (Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}):** $C_0 = 1$ exactly. Tight.

-   **Side Information (Theorem [\[thm:side-info\]](#thm:side-info){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:side-info"}):** Resolution of $k$-way incoherence requires $\geq \log_2 k$ bits.

::: theorem
For any incoherent encoding system and any resolution procedure, there exists a value present in the system that disagrees with the resolution. Without $\log_2 k$ bits of side information (where $k$ = DOF), no resolution is information-theoretically justified.
:::

This parallels zero-error decoding constraints [@korner1973graphs; @lovasz1979shannon]: without sufficient side information, error-free reconstruction is impossible.

## The Capacity Theorem {#sec:optimal-rate}

The zero-incoherence capacity follows the achievability/converse structure of Shannon's channel capacity theorem:

::: center
  **Encoding Rate**    **Zero Incoherence?**   **Interpretation**
  ------------------- ----------------------- --------------------
  DOF $= 0$                     N/A             Fact not encoded
  DOF $= 1$                   **Yes**          Capacity-achieving
  DOF $> 1$                     No               Above capacity
:::

**Comparison to Shannon capacity.** Shannon's channel capacity $C$ is the supremum of rates $R$ achieving vanishing error probability: $\lim_{n \to \infty} P_e^{(n)} = 0$. Our zero-incoherence capacity is the supremum of rates achieving *exactly zero* incoherence probability---paralleling zero-error capacity [@shannon1956zero], not ordinary capacity.

**Connection to MDL.** The capacity theorem generalizes Rissanen's Minimum Description Length principle [@rissanen1978mdl; @gruenwald2007mdl] to interactive systems. MDL optimizes description length for static data. We optimize encoding rate for modifiable data subject to coherence constraints. The result: exactly one rate ($R = 1$) achieves zero incoherence, making this a **forcing theorem**.

## Applications Across Domains {#sec:applications}

The abstract encoding model applies wherever facts are stored redundantly:

-   **Distributed databases:** Replica consistency under partition constraints [@brewer2000cap]

-   **Version control:** Merge resolution when branches diverge [@hunt2002vcdiff]

-   **Configuration systems:** Multi-file settings with coherence requirements [@delaet2010survey]

-   **Software systems:** Class registries, type definitions, interface contracts [@hunt1999pragmatic]

In each domain, the question is identical: given multiple encoding locations, which is authoritative? Our theorems characterize when this question has a unique answer (DOF = 1) versus when it requires arbitrary external resolution (DOF $> 1$).

## Connection to Classical Information Theory {#sec:connection-it}

Our results extend classical source coding theory to interactive multi-terminal systems.

**1. Multi-terminal source coding.** Slepian-Wolf [@slepian1973noiseless] characterizes distributed encoding of correlated sources. We model encoding locations as terminals: derivation introduces *perfect correlation* (deterministic dependence), reducing effective rate. The capacity result shows that only complete correlation (all terminals derived from one source) guarantees coherence---partial correlation permits divergence. Section [\[sec:side-information\]](#sec:side-information){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:side-information"} develops this connection.

**2. Zero-error capacity.** Shannon [@shannon1956zero], Körner [@korner1973graphs], and Lovász [@lovasz1979shannon] characterize zero-error communication. We characterize **zero-incoherence encoding**---a storage analog where "errors" are disagreements among locations. The achievability/converse structure (Theorems [\[thm:capacity-achievability\]](#thm:capacity-achievability){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-achievability"}, [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}) parallels zero-error capacity proofs.

**3. Interactive information theory.** The BIRS workshop [@birs2012interactive] identified interactive IT as encoding/decoding with feedback and multi-round protocols. Our model is interactive: encodings are modified over time, and causal propagation (a realizability requirement) is analogous to channel feedback. Ma-Ishwar [@ma2011distributed] showed interaction can reduce rate; we show derivation (a form of interaction) can reduce effective DOF.

**4. Rate-complexity tradeoffs.** Rate-distortion theory [@cover2006elements] trades rate $R$ against distortion $D$. We trade encoding rate (DOF) against modification complexity $M$: DOF $= 1$ achieves $M = O(1)$; DOF $> 1$ requires $M = \Omega(n)$. The gap is unbounded (Theorem [\[thm:unbounded-gap\]](#thm:unbounded-gap){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:unbounded-gap"}).

## Encoder Realizability {#sec:realizability}

A key question: what encoder properties are necessary and sufficient to achieve capacity ($C_0 = 1$)? We prove realizability requires two information-theoretic properties:

1.  **Causal update propagation (feedback coupling):** Changes to the source must automatically trigger updates to derived locations. This is analogous to *channel coding with feedback* [@cover2006elements]---the encoder (source) and decoder (derived locations) are coupled causally. Without feedback, a temporal window exists where source and derived locations diverge (temporary incoherence).

2.  **Provenance observability (decoder side information):** The system must support queries about derivation structure. This is the encoding-system analog of *Slepian-Wolf side information* [@slepian1973noiseless]---the decoder has access to structural information enabling verification that all terminals are derived from the source.

::: theorem
An encoding system achieves $C_0 = 1$ iff it provides both causal propagation and provenance observability. Neither alone suffices (Theorem [\[thm:independence\]](#thm:independence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:independence"}).
:::

**Connection to multi-version coding.** Rashmi et al. [@rashmi2015multiversion] prove an "inevitable storage cost for consistency" in distributed storage. Our realizability theorem is analogous: systems lacking either encoder property *cannot* achieve capacity---the constraint is information-theoretic, not implementation-specific.

**Instantiations.** The encoder properties instantiate across domains: programming languages (definition-time hooks, introspection), distributed databases (triggers, system catalogs), configuration systems (dependency graphs, state queries). Section [\[sec:evaluation\]](#sec:evaluation){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:evaluation"} provides a programming-language instantiation as a corollary; the core theorems are domain-independent.

## Paper Organization {#overview}

Core theorems (capacity, realizability, complexity bounds) are machine-checked in Lean 4 [@demoura2021lean4] (9,369 lines, 441 theorems, 0 `sorry` placeholders). The entropy and mutual-information arguments in Section [\[sec:info-converse\]](#sec:info-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:info-converse"} apply standard information theory (Fano's inequality [@cover2006elements]); we state these results without separate formalization, as they follow directly from the classical source.

**Section [\[sec:foundations\]](#sec:foundations){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:foundations"}---Encoding Model and Capacity.** We define multi-location encoding systems, encoding rate (DOF), and coherence/incoherence. We introduce information-theoretic quantities (value entropy, redundancy, incoherence entropy). We prove the **zero-incoherence capacity theorem** ($C_0 = 1$) with explicit achievability/converse structure, and the **side information bound** ($\geq \log_2 k$ bits for $k$-way resolution). We formalize encoding-theoretic CAP/FLP.

**Section [\[sec:ssot\]](#sec:ssot){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:ssot"}---Derivation and Optimal Rate.** We characterize derivation as the mechanism achieving capacity: derived locations are perfectly correlated with their source, contributing zero effective rate.

**Section [\[sec:requirements\]](#sec:requirements){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:requirements"}---Encoder Realizability.** We prove that achieving capacity requires causal propagation (feedback) and provenance observability (decoder side information). Both necessary; together sufficient. This is an iff characterization.

**Section [\[sec:bounds\]](#sec:bounds){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:bounds"}---Rate-Complexity Tradeoffs.** We prove modification complexity is $O(1)$ at capacity vs. $\Omega(n)$ above capacity. The gap is unbounded.

**Sections [\[sec:evaluation\]](#sec:evaluation){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:evaluation"}, [\[sec:empirical\]](#sec:empirical){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:empirical"}---Instantiations (Corollaries).** Programming-language instantiation and worked example. These illustrate the abstract theory; core results are domain-independent.

## Core Theorems {#sec:core-theorems}

We establish five *core* theorems:

1.  **Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"} (Zero-Incoherence Capacity):** $C_0 = 1$. The maximum encoding rate guaranteeing zero incoherence is exactly 1.

    *Structure:* Achievability (Theorem [\[thm:capacity-achievability\]](#thm:capacity-achievability){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-achievability"}) + Converse (Theorem [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}).

2.  **Theorem [\[thm:side-info\]](#thm:side-info){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:side-info"} (Side Information Bound):** Resolution of $k$-way incoherence requires $\geq \log_2 k$ bits of side information. At DOF $= 1$, zero bits suffice.

    *Proof:* The $k$ alternatives have entropy $H(S) = \log_2 k$. Resolution requires mutual information $I(S; Y) \geq H(S)$.

3.  **Theorem [\[thm:oracle-arbitrary\]](#thm:oracle-arbitrary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:oracle-arbitrary"} (Resolution Impossibility):** Without side information, no resolution procedure is information-theoretically justified.

    *Proof:* By incoherence, $k \geq 2$ values exist. Any selection leaves $k-1$ values disagreeing. No internal information distinguishes them.

4.  **Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"} (Encoder Realizability):** Achieving capacity requires encoder properties: (a) causal propagation (feedback), and (b) provenance observability (side information). Both necessary; together sufficient.

    *Proof:* Necessity by constructing above-capacity configurations when either is missing. Sufficiency by exhibiting capacity-achieving encoders.

5.  **Theorem [\[thm:unbounded-gap\]](#thm:unbounded-gap){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:unbounded-gap"} (Rate-Complexity Tradeoff):** Modification complexity scales as $O(1)$ at capacity vs. $\Omega(n)$ above capacity. The gap is unbounded.

    *Proof:* At capacity, one source update suffices. Above capacity, $n$ independent locations require $n$ updates.

**Uniqueness.** $C_0 = 1$ is the **unique** capacity: DOF $= 0$ fails to encode; DOF $> 1$ exceeds capacity. Given zero-incoherence as a constraint, the rate is mathematically forced.

## Scope {#sec:scope}

This work characterizes SSOT for *structural facts* (class existence, method signatures, type relationships) within *single-language* systems. The complexity analysis is asymptotic, applying to systems where $n$ grows. External tooling can approximate SSOT behavior but operates outside language semantics.

**Multi-language systems.** When a system spans multiple languages (e.g., Python backend + TypeScript frontend + protobuf schemas), cross-language SSOT requires external code generation tools. The analysis in this paper characterizes single-language SSOT; multi-language SSOT is noted as future work (Section [\[sec:conclusion\]](#sec:conclusion){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:conclusion"}).

# Encoding Systems and Coherence {#sec:foundations}

We formalize encoding systems with modification constraints and prove fundamental limits on coherence. The core results apply universally to any domain where facts are encoded at multiple locations and modifications must preserve correctness. Software systems are one instantiation; distributed databases, configuration management, and version control are others.

## Model assumptions and notation {#sec:assumptions}

For rigour we state the modeling assumptions used throughout the paper. These are intentionally minimal and are made explicit so reviewers can judge applicability.

1.  **Fact value model (A1):** Each fact $F$ takes values in a finite set $\mathcal{V}_F$; $H(F)=\log_2|\mathcal{V}_F|$ denotes its entropy under a chosen prior. When we write "zero probability of incoherence" we mean $\Pr(\text{incoherent})=0$ under the model for edits and randomness specified below.

2.  **Update model (A2):** Modifications occur as discrete events (rounds). An edit $\delta_F$ changes the source value for $F$; derived locations update deterministically when causal propagation is present. We do not require a blocklength parameter; our asymptotic statements are in the number of encoding locations $n$ or in ensemble scaling of the codebase.

3.  **Adversary / randomness (A3):** When randomness is needed we assume a benign stochastic model for edits (e.g., uniformly sampled new values for illustration). For impossibility/converse statements we make no cooperative assumptions of the editor: adversarial sequences of edits that produce incoherence are allowed when DOF $>1$.

4.  **Side-information channel (A4):** Derived locations and runtime queries collectively form side information $S$ available to any verifier. We model $S$ as a random variable correlated with $F$ and use mutual information $I(F;S)$ to quantify its information content.

References to these assumptions use labels (A1)--(A4). Full formal versions of the operational model are given in the mechanized supplement (Supplement A).

## The Encoding Model {#sec:epistemic}

We begin with the abstract encoding model: locations, values, and coherence constraints.

::: definition
[]{#def:encoding-system label="def:encoding-system"} An *encoding system* for a fact $F$ is a collection of locations $\{L_1, \ldots, L_n\}$, each capable of holding a value for $F$.
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:coherence label="def:coherence"} An encoding system is *coherent* iff all locations hold the same value: $$\forall i, j: \text{value}(L_i) = \text{value}(L_j)$$
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:incoherence label="def:incoherence"} An encoding system is *incoherent* iff some locations disagree: $$\exists i, j: \text{value}(L_i) \neq \text{value}(L_j)$$
:::

**The Resolution Problem.** When an encoding system is incoherent, no resolution procedure is information-theoretically justified. Any oracle selecting a value leaves another value disagreeing, creating an unresolvable ambiguity.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:oracle-arbitrary label="thm:oracle-arbitrary"} For any incoherent encoding system $S$ and any oracle $O$ that resolves $S$ to a value $v \in S$, there exists a value $v' \in S$ such that $v' \neq v$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By incoherence, $\exists v_1, v_2 \in S: v_1 \neq v_2$. Either $O$ picks $v_1$ (then $v_2$ disagrees) or $O$ doesn't pick $v_1$ (then $v_1$ disagrees). ◻
:::

**Interpretation.** This theorem parallels zero-error capacity constraints in communication theory. Just as insufficient side information makes error-free decoding impossible, incoherence makes truth-preserving resolution impossible. The encoding system does not contain sufficient information to determine which value is correct. Any resolution requires external information not present in the encodings themselves.

::: definition
[]{#def:dof-epistemic label="def:dof-epistemic"} The *degrees of freedom* (DOF) of an encoding system is the number of locations that can be modified independently.
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:dof-one-coherence label="thm:dof-one-coherence"} If DOF = 1, then the encoding system is coherent in all reachable states.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* With DOF = 1, exactly one location is independent. All other locations are derived (automatically updated when the source changes). Derived locations cannot diverge from their source. Therefore, all locations hold the value determined by the single independent source. Disagreement is impossible. ◻
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence label="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"} If DOF $> 1$, then incoherent states are reachable.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* With DOF $> 1$, at least two locations are independent. Independent locations can be modified separately. A sequence of edits can set $L_1 = v_1$ and $L_2 = v_2$ where $v_1 \neq v_2$. This is an incoherent state. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:coherence-forces-ssot label="cor:coherence-forces-ssot"} If coherence must be guaranteed (no incoherent states reachable), then DOF = 1 is necessary and sufficient.
:::

This is the information-theoretic foundation of optimal encoding under coherence constraints.

**Connection to Minimum Description Length.** The DOF = 1 optimum directly generalizes Rissanen's MDL principle [@rissanen1978mdl]. MDL states that the optimal representation minimizes total description length: $|$model$|$ + $|$data given model$|$. In encoding systems:

-   **DOF = 1:** The single source is the minimal model. All derived locations are "data given model" with zero additional description length (fully determined by the source). Total encoding rate is minimized.

-   **DOF $>$ 1:** Redundant independent locations require explicit synchronization. Each additional independent location adds description length with no reduction in uncertainty---pure overhead serving no encoding purpose.

Grünwald [@gruenwald2007mdl] proves that MDL-optimal representations are unique under mild conditions. Theorem [\[thm:dof-optimal\]](#thm:dof-optimal){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-optimal"} establishes the analogous uniqueness for encoding systems under modification constraints: DOF = 1 is the unique coherence-guaranteeing rate.

**Generative Complexity.** Heering [@heering2015generative] formalized this for computational systems: the *generative complexity* of a program family is the length of the shortest generator. DOF = 1 systems achieve minimal generative complexity---the single source is the generator, derived locations are generated instances. This connects our framework to Kolmogorov complexity while remaining constructive (we provide the generator, not just prove existence).

The following sections show how computational systems instantiate this encoding model.

## Computational Realizations {#sec:edit-space}

The abstract encoding model (Definitions [\[def:encoding-system\]](#def:encoding-system){reference-type="ref" reference="def:encoding-system"}--[\[def:dof-epistemic\]](#def:dof-epistemic){reference-type="ref" reference="def:dof-epistemic"}) applies to any system where:

1.  Facts are encoded at multiple locations

2.  Locations can be modified

3.  Correctness requires coherence across modifications

**Domains satisfying these constraints:**

-   **Software codebases:** Type definitions, registries, configurations

-   **Distributed databases:** Replica consistency under updates

-   **Configuration systems:** Multi-file settings (e.g., infrastructure-as-code)

-   **Version control:** Merge resolution under concurrent modifications

We focus on *computational realizations*---systems where locations are syntactic constructs manipulated by tools or humans. Software codebases are the primary example, but the encoding model is not software-specific. This subsection is illustrative; the core information-theoretic results do not depend on any particular computational domain.

::: definition
A *codebase* $C$ is a finite collection of source files, each containing syntactic constructs (classes, functions, statements, expressions). This is the canonical computational encoding system.
:::

::: definition
A *location* $L \in C$ is a syntactically identifiable region: a class definition, function body, configuration value, type annotation, database field, or configuration entry.
:::

::: definition
For encoding system $C$, the *modification space* $E(C)$ is the set of all valid modifications. Each edit $\delta \in E(C)$ transforms $C$ into $C' = \delta(C)$.
:::

The modification space is large (exponential in system size). But we focus on modifications that *change a specific fact*.

## Facts: Atomic Units of Specification {#sec:facts}

::: definition
[]{#def:fact label="def:fact"} A *fact* $F$ is an atomic unit of program specification: a single piece of knowledge that can be independently modified. Facts are the indivisible units of meaning in a specification.
:::

The granularity of facts is determined by the specification, not the implementation. If two pieces of information must always change together, they constitute a single fact. If they can change independently, they are separate facts.

**Examples of facts:**

:::: center
::: tabularx
lY **Fact** & **Description**\
$F_1$: "threshold = 0.5" & A configuration value\
$F_2$: "`PNGLoader` handles `.png`" & A type-to-handler mapping\
$F_3$: "`validate()` returns `bool`" & A method signature\
$F_4$: "`Detector` is a subclass of `Processor`" & An inheritance relationship\
$F_5$: "`Config` has field `name: str`" & A dataclass field\
:::
::::

::: definition
[]{#def:structural-fact label="def:structural-fact"} A fact $F$ is *structural* with respect to encoding system $C$ iff the locations encoding $F$ are fixed at definition time: $$\text{structural}(F, C) \Longleftrightarrow \forall L: \text{encodes}(L, F) \rightarrow L \in \text{DefinitionSyntax}(C)$$ where $\text{DefinitionSyntax}(C)$ comprises declarative constructs that cannot change post-definition without recreation.
:::

**Examples across domains:**

-   **Software:** Class declarations, method signatures, inheritance clauses, attribute definitions

-   **Databases:** Schema definitions, table structures, foreign key constraints

-   **Configuration:** Infrastructure topology, service dependencies

-   **Version control:** Branch structure, merge policies

**Key property:** Structural facts are fixed at *definition time*. Once defined, their structure cannot change without recreation. This is why structural coherence requires definition-time computation: the encoding locations are only mutable during creation.

**Non-structural facts** (runtime values, mutable state) have encoding locations modifiable post-definition. Achieving DOF = 1 for non-structural facts requires different mechanisms (reactive bindings, event systems) and is outside this paper's scope. We focus on structural facts because they demonstrate the impossibility results most clearly.

## Encoding: The Correctness Relationship {#sec:encoding}

::: definition
[]{#def:encodes label="def:encodes"} Location $L$ *encodes* fact $F$, written $\text{encodes}(L, F)$, iff correctness requires updating $L$ when $F$ changes.

Formally: $$\text{encodes}(L, F) \Longleftrightarrow \forall \delta_F: \neg\text{updated}(L, \delta_F) \rightarrow \text{incorrect}(\delta_F(C))$$

where $\delta_F$ is an edit targeting fact $F$.
:::

**Key insight:** This definition is **forced** by correctness, not chosen. We do not decide what encodes what. Correctness requirements determine it. If failing to update location $L$ when fact $F$ changes produces an incorrect program, then $L$ encodes $F$. This is an objective, observable property.

:::: example
[]{#ex:encoding label="ex:encoding"} Consider a type registry:

::: code
\# Location L1: Class definition class PNGLoader(ImageLoader): format = \"png\"

\# Location L2: Registry entry LOADERS = \"png\": PNGLoader, \"jpg\": JPGLoader

\# Location L3: Documentation \# Supported formats: png, jpg
:::

The fact $F$ = "`PNGLoader` handles `png`" is encoded at:

-   $L_1$: The class definition (primary encoding)

-   $L_2$: The registry dictionary (secondary encoding)

-   $L_3$: The documentation comment (tertiary encoding)

If $F$ changes (e.g., to "`PNGLoader` handles `png` and `apng`"), all three locations must be updated for correctness. The program is incorrect if $L_2$ still says `{"png": PNGLoader}` when the class now handles both formats.
::::

## Modification Complexity {#sec:mod-complexity}

::: definition
[]{#def:mod-complexity label="def:mod-complexity"} $$M(C, \delta_F) = |\{L \in C : \text{encodes}(L, F)\}|$$ The number of locations that must be updated when fact $F$ changes.
:::

Modification complexity is the central metric of this paper. It measures the *cost* of changing a fact. A codebase with $M(C, \delta_F) = 47$ requires 47 edits to correctly implement a change to fact $F$. A codebase with $M(C, \delta_F) = 1$ requires only 1 edit.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:correctness-forcing label="thm:correctness-forcing"} $M(C, \delta_F)$ is the **minimum** number of edits required for correctness. Fewer edits imply an incorrect program.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Suppose $M(C, \delta_F) = k$, meaning $k$ locations encode $F$. By Definition [\[def:encodes\]](#def:encodes){reference-type="ref" reference="def:encodes"}, each encoding location must be updated when $F$ changes. If only $j < k$ locations are updated, then $k - j$ locations still reflect the old value of $F$. These locations create inconsistencies:

1.  The specification says $F$ has value $v'$ (new)

2.  Locations $L_1, \ldots, L_j$ reflect $v'$

3.  Locations $L_{j+1}, \ldots, L_k$ reflect $v$ (old)

By Definition [\[def:encodes\]](#def:encodes){reference-type="ref" reference="def:encodes"}, the program is incorrect. Therefore, all $k$ locations must be updated, and $k$ is the minimum. ◻

Not all encoding locations are created equal. Some are *derived* from others.

::: definition
[]{#def:independent label="def:independent"} Locations $L_1, L_2$ are *independent* for fact $F$ iff they can diverge. Updating $L_1$ does not automatically update $L_2$, and vice versa.

Formally: $L_1$ and $L_2$ are independent iff there exists a sequence of edits that makes $L_1$ and $L_2$ encode different values for $F$.

Here $L_1$ and $L_2$ are independent. A developer can change $L_1$ without updating $L_2$, causing inconsistency.

*Proof.* Each independent location can hold a different value. By Definition [\[def:independent\]](#def:independent){reference-type="ref" reference="def:independent"}, no constraint forces agreement between independent locations. Therefore, $k$ independent locations can hold $k$ distinct values.

3.  DOF $>$ 1: Incoherence reachable (by Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"})

This is formalized as the Zero-Incoherence Capacity theorem (Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}) in Section [1.11](#sec:capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:capacity"}.

Informally: each encoding location can be updated without coordinating with others.

::: definition
[]{#def:partition-tolerance label="def:partition-tolerance"} An encoding system for fact $F$ is *partition-tolerant* iff $F$ is encoded at two or more locations: $$|\{L \in C : \text{encodes}(L, F)\}| \ge 2.$$ This is the minimal formal notion of "replication" in our model; without it, partitions are vacuous.
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:cap-encoding label="thm:cap-encoding"} No encoding system can simultaneously guarantee coherence (Definition [\[def:coherence\]](#def:coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="def:coherence"}), local availability (Definition [\[def:local-availability\]](#def:local-availability){reference-type="ref" reference="def:local-availability"}), and partition tolerance (Definition [\[def:partition-tolerance\]](#def:partition-tolerance){reference-type="ref" reference="def:partition-tolerance"}) for the same fact $F$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Partition tolerance gives at least two encoding locations. Local availability allows each to be updated without updating any other encoding location, so by Definition [\[def:independent\]](#def:independent){reference-type="ref" reference="def:independent"} there exist two independent locations and thus $\text{DOF}(C, F) > 1$.

:::

These theorems are the encoding-theoretic counterparts of CAP [@brewer2000cap; @gilbert2002cap] and FLP [@flp1985impossibility]: CAP corresponds to the impossibility of coherence when replicated encodings remain independently updatable; FLP corresponds to the impossibility of truth-preserving resolution in an incoherent state without side information.

## Information-Theoretic Quantities {#sec:it-quantities}

Before establishing the capacity theorem, we define the information-theoretic quantities that characterize encoding systems.

::: definition

:::

::: definition
[]{#def:value-entropy label="def:value-entropy"} For a fact $F$ with value space $\mathcal{V}_F$, the *value entropy* is: $$H(F) = \log_2 |\mathcal{V}_F|$$ This is the information content of specifying $F$'s value.
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:redundancy label="def:redundancy"} The *encoding redundancy* of system $C$ for fact $F$ is: $$\rho(C, F) = \text{DOF}(C, F) - 1$$ Redundancy measures excess independent encodings beyond the minimum needed to represent $F$.
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:redundancy-incoherence label="thm:redundancy-incoherence"} Encoding redundancy $\rho > 0$ is necessary and sufficient for incoherence reachability: $$\rho(C, F) > 0 \Longleftrightarrow \text{incoherent states reachable}$$
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* $(\Rightarrow)$ If $\rho > 0$, then DOF $> 1$. By Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"}, incoherent states are reachable.

$(\Leftarrow)$ If incoherent states are reachable, then by contrapositive of Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"}, DOF $\neq 1$. Since the fact is encoded, DOF $\geq 1$, so DOF $> 1$, hence $\rho > 0$. ◻
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:incoherence-entropy label="def:incoherence-entropy"} For an incoherent state with $k$ independent locations holding distinct values, the *incoherence entropy* is: $$H_{\text{inc}} = \log_2 k$$ This quantifies the uncertainty about which value is "correct."
:::

## Zero-Incoherence Capacity Theorem {#sec:capacity}

We now establish the central capacity result. This extends zero-error capacity theory [@korner1973graphs; @lovasz1979shannon] to interactive encoding systems with modification constraints.

**Background: Zero-Error Capacity.** Shannon [@shannon1956zero] introduced zero-error capacity: the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted with *zero* probability of error (not vanishing, but exactly zero). Körner [@korner1973graphs] and Lovász [@lovasz1979shannon] characterized this via graph entropy and confusability graphs. Our zero-incoherence capacity is analogous: the maximum encoding rate guaranteeing *zero* probability of incoherence.

::: definition
[]{#def:coherence-capacity label="def:coherence-capacity"} The *zero-incoherence capacity* of an encoding system is: $$C_0 = \sup\{R : \text{encoding rate } R \Rightarrow \text{incoherence probability} = 0\}$$ where "incoherence probability = 0" means no incoherent state is reachable under any modification sequence.
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:coherence-capacity label="thm:coherence-capacity"} The zero-incoherence capacity of any encoding system under independent modification is exactly 1: $$C_0 = 1$$
:::

We prove this via the standard achievability/converse structure. (These formalize Theorems [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"} and [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"} in IT capacity-proof style.)

::: theorem
[]{#thm:capacity-achievability label="thm:capacity-achievability"} Encoding rate DOF $= 1$ achieves zero incoherence. Therefore $C_0 \geq 1$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let DOF$(C, F) = 1$. By Definition [\[def:dof\]](#def:dof){reference-type="ref" reference="def:dof"}, exactly one location $L_s$ is independent; all other locations $\{L_i\}$ are derived from $L_s$.

By Definition [\[def:derived\]](#def:derived){reference-type="ref" reference="def:derived"}, derived locations satisfy: $\text{update}(L_s) \Rightarrow \text{automatically\_updated}(L_i)$. Therefore, for any reachable state: $$\forall i: \text{value}(L_i) = f_i(\text{value}(L_s))$$ where $f_i$ is the derivation function. All values are determined by $L_s$. Disagreement requires two locations with different determining sources, but only $L_s$ exists. Therefore, no incoherent state is reachable. ◻
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:capacity-converse label="thm:capacity-converse"} Encoding rate DOF $> 1$ does not achieve zero incoherence. Therefore $C_0 < R$ for all $R > 1$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let DOF$(C, F) = k > 1$. By Definition [\[def:independent\]](#def:independent){reference-type="ref" reference="def:independent"}, there exist locations $L_1, L_2$ that can be modified independently.

**Construction of incoherent state:** Consider the modification sequence:

1.  $\delta_1$: Set $L_1 = v_1$ for some $v_1 \in \mathcal{V}_F$

2.  $\delta_2$: Set $L_2 = v_2$ for some $v_2 \neq v_1$

Both modifications are valid (each location accepts values from $\mathcal{V}_F$). By independence, $\delta_2$ does not affect $L_1$. The resulting state has: $$\text{value}(L_1) = v_1 \neq v_2 = \text{value}(L_2)$$

By Definition [\[def:incoherence\]](#def:incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="def:incoherence"}, this state is incoherent. Since it is reachable, zero incoherence is not achieved.

**Fano-style argument.** We can also prove the converse via an entropy argument analogous to Fano's inequality. Let $X_i$ denote the value at location $L_i$. With DOF $= k > 1$, the $k$ independent locations have joint entropy $H(X_1, \ldots, X_k) = k \cdot H(F)$ (each independently samples from $\mathcal{V}_F$). For coherence, we require $X_1 = X_2 = \cdots = X_k$, which constrains the joint distribution to the diagonal $\{(v, v, \ldots, v) : v \in \mathcal{V}_F\}$---a set of measure zero in the product space when $k > 1$. Thus the probability of coherence under independent modifications is zero, and the probability of incoherence is one. ◻
:::

::: proof
*Proof of Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}.* By Theorem [\[thm:capacity-achievability\]](#thm:capacity-achievability){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-achievability"}, $C_0 \geq 1$.

By Theorem [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}, $C_0 < R$ for all $R > 1$.

Therefore $C_0 = 1$ exactly. The bound is tight: achieved at DOF $= 1$, not achieved at any DOF $> 1$. ◻
:::

**Comparison to Shannon capacity.** The structure parallels Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem [@shannon1948mathematical]:

::: center
                  **Shannon (Channel)**       **This Work (Encoding)**
  --------------- --------------------------- --------------------------------
  Rate            Bits per channel use        Independent encoding locations
  Constraint      Error probability $\to 0$   Incoherence probability $= 0$
  Achievability   $R < C$ achieves            DOF $= 1$ achieves
  Converse        $R > C$ fails               DOF $> 1$ fails
  Capacity        $C = \max I(X;Y)$           $C_0 = 1$
:::

The key difference: Shannon capacity allows vanishing error; zero-incoherence capacity requires *exactly* zero, paralleling zero-error capacity.

::: corollary
[]{#cor:capacity-unique label="cor:capacity-unique"} DOF $= 1$ is the unique capacity-achieving encoding rate. No alternative achieves zero incoherence at higher rate.
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:redundancy-above label="cor:redundancy-above"} Any encoding with $\rho > 0$ (redundancy) operates above capacity and cannot guarantee coherence.
:::

### Rate-Incoherence Function

Analogous to the rate-distortion function $R(D)$ in lossy source coding, we define the *rate-incoherence function*:

::: definition
[]{#def:rate-incoherence label="def:rate-incoherence"} The rate-incoherence function is: $$R(\epsilon) = \inf\{R : \exists \text{ encoding achieving } P(\text{incoherence}) \leq \epsilon\}$$ where $\epsilon \in [0, 1]$ is the tolerable incoherence probability.
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:rate-incoherence-step label="thm:rate-incoherence-step"} The rate-incoherence function is discrete (all-or-nothing at $\epsilon=0$): $$R(\epsilon) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \epsilon = 0 \\
\infty & \text{if } \epsilon > 0
\end{cases}$$
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* For $\epsilon = 0$ (zero incoherence tolerated): By Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}, the minimum rate achieving $P(\text{incoherence}) = 0$ is exactly DOF $= 1$. Thus $R(0) = 1$.

For $\epsilon > 0$ (some incoherence tolerated): Any DOF $\geq 1$ is achievable---there is no upper bound on rate when incoherence is permitted. Thus $R(\epsilon) = \infty$ (no finite constraint). ◻
:::

**Interpretation.** Unlike rate-distortion, which exhibits smooth tradeoffs, the rate-incoherence function is discontinuous. There is no "graceful degradation": either you operate at capacity (DOF $= 1$, zero incoherence) or you have no coherence guarantee whatsoever. This discontinuity reflects the qualitative nature of correctness---a system is either coherent or it is not; there is no intermediate state.

### Design Necessity

The capacity theorem yields a prescriptive result for system design:

::: theorem
[]{#thm:design-necessity label="thm:design-necessity"} If an encoding system requires zero incoherence for correctness, then the encoding rate must satisfy DOF $\leq 1$. This is a necessary condition; no design choice can circumvent it.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Suppose a system requires $P(\text{incoherence}) = 0$ and has DOF $> 1$. By Theorem [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}, incoherent states are reachable. This contradicts the requirement. Therefore DOF $\leq 1$ is necessary.

The bound is not an implementation artifact but an information-theoretic limit. No clever engineering, additional tooling, or process discipline changes the fundamental constraint: with DOF $> 1$, independent locations can diverge. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:architectural-forcing label="cor:architectural-forcing"} For any fact $F$ requiring coherence guarantees, system architecture must either:

1.  Achieve DOF$(F) = 1$ through derivation mechanisms, or

2.  Accept that coherence cannot be guaranteed and implement resolution protocols with $\geq \log_2(\text{DOF})$ bits of side information.

There is no third option.
:::

### Coding Interpretation of Derivation

The capacity theorem admits a coding-theoretic interpretation: *derivation is the capacity-achieving code*.

**Codebook analogy.** In channel coding, a codebook maps messages to codewords. The capacity-achieving code is the one that achieves the maximum rate with vanishing error. In encoding systems:

-   The "message" is the fact $F$'s value

-   The "codeword" is the encoding across all locations

-   The "code" is the derivation structure---how locations depend on each other

A DOF $= 1$ derivation structure is a *capacity-achieving code*: it encodes $F$ at exactly one independent location (rate 1) with zero incoherence (zero "error"). Derived locations are redundant symbols determined by the source---they add reliability (the value is readable at multiple locations) without adding rate (no independent information).

**Redundancy without rate.** In classical coding, redundancy increases reliability at the cost of rate. In DOF-1 encoding, derived locations provide redundancy (multiple copies of $F$'s value) without rate cost---they are deterministic functions of the source. This is the information-theoretic sense in which derivation is "free": derived encodings do not consume encoding rate.

### Connection to Confusability Graphs

Körner [@korner1973graphs] and Lovász [@lovasz1979shannon] characterized zero-error capacity via *confusability graphs*: vertices are channel inputs, edges connect inputs that can produce the same output. Zero-error capacity is determined by the graph's independence number.

We can define an analogous *incoherence graph* for encoding systems:

::: definition
[]{#def:incoherence-graph label="def:incoherence-graph"} For encoding system $C$ and fact $F$, the incoherence graph $G = (V, E)$ has:

-   Vertices $V =$ independent encoding locations

-   Edge $(L_i, L_j) \in E$ iff $L_i$ and $L_j$ can hold different values (are truly independent)
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:incoherence-graph label="thm:incoherence-graph"} Zero incoherence is achievable iff the incoherence graph has at most one vertex: $|V| \leq 1$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* If $|V| = 0$, no locations encode $F$. If $|V| = 1$, DOF $= 1$ and zero incoherence is achieved by Theorem [\[thm:capacity-achievability\]](#thm:capacity-achievability){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-achievability"}. If $|V| \geq 2$, DOF $\geq 2$ and incoherence is reachable by Theorem [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}. ◻
:::

This connects our capacity theorem to the Körner-Lovász theory: zero-error/zero-incoherence capacity is determined by a graph structure, and the capacity-achieving configuration corresponds to a degenerate graph (single vertex).

## Side Information for Resolution {#sec:side-information}

When an encoding system is incoherent, resolution requires external side information. We establish a tight bound on the required side information, connecting to Slepian-Wolf distributed source coding.

### The Multi-Terminal View

We can view an encoding system as a *multi-terminal source coding* problem [@slepian1973noiseless; @cover2006elements]:

-   Each encoding location is a *terminal* that can transmit (store) a value

-   The fact $F$ is the *source* to be encoded

-   *Derivation* introduces correlation: a derived terminal's output is a deterministic function of its source terminal

-   The *decoder* (any observer querying the system) must reconstruct $F$'s value

In Slepian-Wolf coding, correlated sources $(X, Y)$ can be encoded at rates $(R_X, R_Y)$ satisfying $R_X \geq H(X|Y)$, $R_Y \geq H(Y|X)$, $R_X + R_Y \geq H(X,Y)$. With perfect correlation ($Y = f(X)$), we have $H(X|Y) = 0$---the correlated source needs zero rate.

**Derivation as perfect correlation.** In our model, derivation creates perfect correlation: if $L_d$ is derived from $L_s$, then $\text{value}(L_d) = f(\text{value}(L_s))$ deterministically. The "rate" of $L_d$ is effectively zero---it contributes no independent information. This is why derived locations do not contribute to DOF.

**Independence as zero correlation.** Independent locations have no correlation. Each can hold any value in $\mathcal{V}_F$. The total "rate" is DOF $\cdot H(F)$, but with DOF $> 1$, the locations can encode *different* values---incoherence.

### Side Information Bound

::: theorem
[]{#thm:side-info label="thm:side-info"} Given an incoherent encoding system with $k$ independent locations holding distinct values $\{v_1, \ldots, v_k\}$, resolving to the correct value requires at least $\log_2 k$ bits of side information.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* The $k$ independent locations partition the value space into $k$ equally plausible alternatives. By Theorem [\[thm:oracle-arbitrary\]](#thm:oracle-arbitrary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:oracle-arbitrary"}, no internal information distinguishes them---each is an equally valid "source."

Let $S \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ denote the index of the correct source. The decoder must determine $S$ to resolve correctly. Since $S$ is uniformly distributed over $k$ alternatives (by symmetry of the incoherent state): $$H(S) = \log_2 k$$

Any resolution procedure is a function $R: \text{State} \to \mathcal{V}_F$. Without side information $Y$: $$H(S | R(\text{State})) = H(S) = \log_2 k$$ because $R$ can be computed from the state, which contains no information about which source is correct.

With side information $Y$ that identifies the correct source: $$H(S | Y) = 0 \Rightarrow I(S; Y) = H(S) = \log_2 k$$

Therefore, side information must provide at least $\log_2 k$ bits of mutual information with $S$. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:dof1-zero-side label="cor:dof1-zero-side"} With DOF = 1, resolution requires 0 bits of side information.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* With $k = 1$, there is one independent location. $H(S) = \log_2 1 = 0$. No uncertainty exists about the authoritative source. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:side-info-redundancy label="cor:side-info-redundancy"} The required side information equals $\log_2(1 + \rho)$ where $\rho$ is encoding redundancy: $$\text{Side information required} = \log_2(\text{DOF}) = \log_2(1 + \rho)$$
:::

**Connection to Slepian-Wolf.** In Slepian-Wolf coding, the decoder has side information $Y$ and decodes $X$ at rate $H(X|Y)$. Our setting inverts this: the decoder needs side information $S$ (source identity) to "decode" (resolve) which value is correct. The required side information is exactly the entropy of the source-selection variable.

**Connection to zero-error decoding.** In zero-error channel coding, the decoder must identify the transmitted message with certainty. Without sufficient side information (channel structure), this is impossible. Similarly, without $\log_2 k$ bits identifying the authoritative source, zero-error resolution is impossible.

::: example
[]{#ex:side-info-practice label="ex:side-info-practice"} Consider a configuration system with DOF = 3:

-   `config.yaml`: `threshold: 0.5`

-   `settings.json`: `"threshold": 0.7`

-   `params.toml`: `threshold = 0.6`

Resolution requires $\log_2 3 \approx 1.58$ bits of side information:

-   A priority ordering: "YAML $>$ JSON $>$ TOML" (encodes permutation $\to$ identifies source)

-   A timestamp comparison: "most recent wins" (encodes ordering $\to$ identifies source)

-   An explicit declaration: "params.toml is authoritative" (directly encodes source identity)

With DOF = 1, zero bits suffice---the single source is self-evidently authoritative.
:::

### Multi-Terminal Capacity Interpretation

The zero-incoherence capacity theorem (Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}) can be restated in multi-terminal language:

::: corollary
[]{#cor:multi-terminal label="cor:multi-terminal"} An encoding system achieves zero incoherence iff all terminals are perfectly correlated (every terminal's output is a deterministic function of one source terminal). Equivalently: the correlation structure must be a tree with one root.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Perfect correlation means DOF = 1 (only the root is independent). By Theorem [\[thm:capacity-achievability\]](#thm:capacity-achievability){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-achievability"}, this achieves zero incoherence. If any two terminals are independent (not perfectly correlated through the root), DOF $\geq 2$, and by Theorem [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}, incoherence is reachable. ◻
:::

This connects to network information theory: in a multi-terminal network, achieving coherence requires complete dependence on a single source---no "multicast" of independent copies.

## Structure Theorems: The Derivation Lattice {#sec:derivation-structure}

The set of derivation relations on an encoding system has algebraic structure. We characterize this structure and its computational implications.

::: definition

*Proof.* **Bottom:** $\emptyset$ is trivially a derivation relation with all locations independent.

**Top:** For $n$ locations, a maximal acyclic relation has one source (root) and $n-1$ derived locations forming a tree or DAG. DOF = 1.

**Meet:** Intersection of acyclic relations is acyclic. The intersection preserves only derivations present in both.

**Join:** If $D_1 \cup D_2$ is acyclic, its transitive closure is the smallest relation containing both. If cyclic, join is undefined (partial lattice).

Bounded: $\emptyset \subseteq D \subseteq \top$ for all valid $D$. ◻

[]{#thm:dof-antimonotone label="thm:dof-antimonotone"} DOF is anti-monotonic in the derivation lattice: $$D_1 \subseteq D_2 \Rightarrow \text{DOF}(D_1) \geq \text{DOF}(D_2)$$ More derivations imply fewer independent locations.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Adding a derivation edge $(L_s, L_d)$ to $D$ can only decrease DOF: if $L_d$ was previously a source (no incoming edges), it now has an incoming edge and is no longer a source. Sources can only decrease or stay constant as derivations are added. ◻

**Computational implication:** Given an encoding system, there can be multiple DOF-1-achieving derivation structures. The minimal ones use the fewest derivation edges---the most economical way to achieve coherence.

**Representation model for complexity.** For the algorithmic results below, we assume the derivation relation $D$ is given explicitly as a DAG over the location set $L$. The input size is $|L| + |D|$, and all complexity bounds are measured in this explicit representation.

*Proof.* **(1) DOF computation:** Count locations with in-degree 0 in the DAG. Single pass over edges: $O(|D|)$ to compute in-degrees, $O(|L|)$ to count zeros.

**(2) DOF = 1 decision:** Compute DOF, compare to 1. Same complexity.

**(3) Minimal extension:** Must connect $k-1$ source locations to reduce DOF from $k$ to 1. Finding which connections preserve acyclicity requires reachability queries. Naive: $O(|L|^2)$. With better data structures (e.g., dynamic reachability): $O(|L| \cdot |D|)$ amortized. ◻

# Optimal Encoding Rate (DOF = 1) {#sec:ssot}

Having established the encoding model (Section [\[sec:epistemic\]](#sec:epistemic){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:epistemic"}), we now prove that DOF = 1 is the unique optimal rate guaranteeing coherence under modification constraints.

## DOF = 1 as Optimal Rate {#sec:ssot-def}

DOF = 1 is not a design guideline. It is the information-theoretically optimal rate guaranteeing coherence for facts encoded in systems with modification constraints.

::: definition
[]{#def:ssot label="def:ssot"} Encoding system $C$ achieves *optimal encoding rate* for fact $F$ iff: $$\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$$ Equivalently: exactly one independent encoding location exists for $F$. All other encodings are derived.
:::

**This generalizes the "Single Source of Truth" (SSOT) principle from software engineering to universal encoding theory.**

**Encoding-theoretic interpretation:**

-   DOF = 1 means exactly one independent encoding location

-   All other locations are derived (cannot diverge from source)

-   Incoherence is *impossible*, not merely unlikely

-   The encoding rate is minimized subject to coherence constraint

::: corollary
[]{#thm:ssot-determinate label="thm:ssot-determinate"} If $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$, then for all reachable states of $C$, the value of $F$ is determinate: all encodings agree. *(This restates Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"} in terms of determinacy.)*
:::

Hunt & Thomas's "single, unambiguous, authoritative representation" [@hunt1999pragmatic] (SSOT principle) corresponds precisely to this encoding-theoretic structure:

-   **Single:** DOF = 1 (exactly one independent encoding)

-   **Unambiguous:** No incoherent states possible (Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"})

-   **Authoritative:** The source determines all derived values (Definition [\[def:derived\]](#def:derived){reference-type="ref" reference="def:derived"})

Our contribution is proving that SSOT is not a heuristic but an information-theoretic optimality condition.

::: corollary
[]{#thm:ssot-optimal label="thm:ssot-optimal"} If $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$, then coherence restoration requires $O(1)$ updates: modifying the single source maintains coherence automatically via derivation. *(See Theorem [\[thm:upper-bound\]](#thm:upper-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:upper-bound"} for the full rate-complexity bound.)*
:::

::: corollary
[]{#thm:ssot-unique label="thm:ssot-unique"} DOF = 1 is the **unique** rate guaranteeing coherence. DOF = 0 fails to represent $F$; DOF $> 1$ permits incoherence. *(This is the Zero-Incoherence Capacity theorem; see Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}.)*

::: corollary
[]{#cor:no-redundancy label="cor:no-redundancy"} Multiple independent sources encoding the same fact permit incoherent states. DOF $> 1 \Rightarrow$ incoherence reachable.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Direct application of Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"}. With DOF $> 1$, independent locations can be modified separately, reaching states where they disagree. ◻
:::

See the formal Zero-Incoherence Capacity statement in Section [\[sec:capacity\]](#sec:capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:capacity"} (Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}). A concise proof sketch appears below; the full mechanized proof is provided in Supplement A.

## Information-theoretic proof sketches {#sec:info-sketches}

We give concise proof sketches connecting the combinatorial DOF arguments to standard information-theoretic tools:

-   **Converse (Fano):** To show that limited side information cannot enable vanishing-error recovery of $F$, apply the Fano-style bound (Theorem [\[thm:fano-converse\]](#thm:fano-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:fano-converse"}). If the mutual information $I(F;S)$ provided by derived locations is $<\log K - o(1)$ for $K$ possible values, then any estimator has $P_e$ bounded away from zero. Thus perfect recoverability requires $I(F;S)\approx H(F)$, i.e. essentially $\log K$ bits.

-   **Confusability graph:** Lemma [\[lem:confusability-clique\]](#lem:confusability-clique){reference-type="ref" reference="lem:confusability-clique"} converts combinatorial indistinguishability (cliques) into information lower bounds: a $k$-clique forces $\log k$ bits of side information for vanishing error. This gives a language-independent certificate that side information is insufficient in environments with limited introspection.

-   **DOF implication:** If side information cannot supply the required mutual information, the system must retain multiple independent encodings (higher DOF) to achieve correctness under modifications. Higher DOF incurs $\Omega(n)$ manual edits (Theorem [\[thm:lower-bound\]](#thm:lower-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:lower-bound"}), completing the converse chain from information constraints to modification complexity.

## Rate-Complexity Tradeoff {#sec:ssot-vs-m}

The DOF metric creates a fundamental tradeoff between encoding rate and modification complexity.

**Question:** When fact $F$ changes, how many manual updates are required to restore coherence?

-   **DOF = 1:** $O(1)$ updates. The single source determines all derived locations automatically.

-   **DOF = $n > 1$:** $\Omega(n)$ updates. Each independent location must be synchronized manually.

This is a *rate-distortion* analog: higher encoding rate (DOF $> 1$) incurs higher modification complexity. DOF = 1 achieves minimal complexity under the coherence constraint.

**Key insight:** Many locations can encode $F$ (high total encoding locations), but if DOF = 1, coherence restoration requires only 1 manual update. The derivation mechanism handles propagation automatically.

::: example
[]{#ex:ssot-large-m label="ex:ssot-large-m"} Consider an encoding system where a fact $F$ = "all processors must implement operation $P$" is encoded at 51 locations:

-   1 abstract specification location

-   50 concrete implementation locations

**Architecture A (DOF = 51):** All 51 locations are independent.

-   Modification complexity: Changing $F$ requires 51 manual updates

-   Coherence risk: After $k < 51$ updates, system is incoherent (partial updates)

-   Only after all 51 updates is coherence restored

**Architecture B (DOF = 1):** The abstract specification is the single source; implementations are derived.

-   Modification complexity: Changing $F$ requires 1 update (the specification)

-   Coherence guarantee: Derived locations update automatically via enforcement mechanism

-   The *specification* has a single authoritative source

**Computational realization (software):** Abstract base classes with enforcement (type checkers, runtime validation) achieve DOF = 1 for contract specifications. Changing the abstract method signature updates the contract; type checkers flag non-compliant implementations.

Note: Implementations are separate facts. DOF = 1 for the contract specification does not eliminate implementation updates---it ensures the specification itself is determinate.
:::

## Derivation: The Coherence Mechanism {#sec:derivation}

Derivation is the mechanism by which DOF is reduced without losing encodings. A derived location cannot diverge from its source, eliminating it as a source of incoherence.

::: definition
[]{#def:derivation label="def:derivation"} Location $L_{\text{derived}}$ is *derived from* $L_{\text{source}}$ for fact $F$ iff: $$\text{updated}(L_{\text{source}}) \rightarrow \text{automatically\_updated}(L_{\text{derived}})$$ No manual intervention is required. Coherence is maintained automatically.
:::

Derivation can occur at different times depending on the encoding system:

:::: center
::: tabularx
lY **Derivation Time** & **Examples Across Domains**\
Compile/Build time & C++ templates, Rust macros, database schema generation, infrastructure-as-code compilation\
Definition time & Python metaclasses, ORM model registration, dynamic schema creation\
Query/Access time & Database views, computed columns, lazy evaluation\
:::
::::

**Structural facts require definition-time derivation.** Structural facts (class existence, schema structure, service topology) are fixed when defined. Compile-time derivation that runs before the definition is fixed is too early (the declarative source is not yet fixed). Runtime is too late (structure already immutable). Definition-time is the unique opportunity for structural derivation.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:derivation-excludes label="thm:derivation-excludes"} If $L_{\text{derived}}$ is derived from $L_{\text{source}}$, then $L_{\text{derived}}$ cannot diverge from $L_{\text{source}}$ and does not contribute to DOF.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By Definition [\[def:derivation\]](#def:derivation){reference-type="ref" reference="def:derivation"}, derived locations are automatically updated when the source changes. Let $L_d$ be derived from $L_s$. If $L_s$ encodes value $v$, then $L_d$ encodes $f(v)$ for some function $f$. When $L_s$ changes to $v'$, $L_d$ automatically changes to $f(v')$.

There is no reachable state where $L_s = v'$ and $L_d = f(v)$ with $v' \neq v$. Divergence is impossible. Therefore, $L_d$ does not contribute to DOF. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:metaprogramming label="cor:metaprogramming"} If all encodings of $F$ except one are derived from that one, then $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$ and coherence is guaranteed.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $L_s$ be the non-derived encoding. All other encodings $L_1, \ldots, L_k$ are derived from $L_s$. By Theorem [\[thm:derivation-excludes\]](#thm:derivation-excludes){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:derivation-excludes"}, none can diverge. Only $L_s$ is independent. Therefore, $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$, and by Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"}, coherence is guaranteed. ◻
:::

## Computational Realizations of DOF = 1 {#sec:ssot-patterns}

DOF = 1 is achieved across computational domains using definition-time derivation mechanisms. We show examples from software, databases, and configuration systems.

**Software: Subclass Registration (Python)**

::: code
class Registry: \_registry = def \_\_init_subclass\_\_(cls, \*\*kwargs): Registry.\_registry\[cls.\_\_name\_\_\] = cls

class PNGHandler(Registry): \# Automatically registered pass
:::

**Encoding structure:**

-   Source: Class definition (declared once)

-   Derived: Registry dictionary entry (computed at definition time via `__init_subclass__`)

-   DOF = 1: Registry cannot diverge from class hierarchy

**Databases: Materialized Views**

::: code
CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMP); CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_count AS SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM users;
:::

**Encoding structure:**

-   Source: Base table `users`

-   Derived: Materialized view `user_count` (updated on refresh)

-   DOF = 1: View cannot diverge from base table (consistency guaranteed by DBMS)

**Configuration: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**

::: code
resource \"aws_instance\" \"app\" ami = \"ami-12345\" instance_type = \"t2.micro\"

output \"instance_ip\" value = aws_instance.app.public_ip
:::

**Encoding structure:**

-   Source: Resource declaration (authoritative configuration)

-   Derived: Output value (computed from resource state)

-   DOF = 1: Output cannot diverge from actual resource (computed at apply time)

**Common pattern:** In all cases, the source is declared once, and derived locations are computed automatically at definition/build/query time. Manual synchronization is eliminated. Coherence is guaranteed by the system, not developer discipline.


# Information-Theoretic Realizability Requirements {#sec:requirements}

This section identifies, at an abstract information-theoretic level, the two properties an encoding system must provide to realize DOF = 1. Concrete programming-language and system-level instantiations are presented in the supplementary material; here we present the abstract requirements and their necessity/sufficiency proofs.

Informally, an encoding system provides a set of locations holding values and a space of allowed modifications. DOF = 1 is realizable when exactly one independent location exists (the source) and all other encodings are deterministic functions (derivations) of that source so divergence is impossible.

We show that two encoder properties are necessary and sufficient:

1.  **Causal update propagation:** updates to the source must automatically propagate to derived locations (eliminating transient incoherence windows);

2.  **Provenance observability:** the system must expose, to verification procedures, which locations are sources and which are derived (providing the side information necessary to verify DOF = 1).

The remainder of this section gives formal statements and proofs of necessity and sufficiency for these properties in the abstract model.

## Confusability and Side-Information {#sec:confusability}

To connect realizability to the information available at runtime, define the *confusability graph* for a fact $F$: vertices are distinct values of $F$, and an undirected edge joins two values $x,x'$ iff they are indistinguishable given the available side information (i.e., no observation of derived locations can reliably separate $x$ from $x'$).

::: lemma
[]{#lem:confusability-clique label="lem:confusability-clique"} If the confusability graph for $F$ contains a clique of size $k$, then any side-information channel that yields vanishing error probability for distinguishing all $k$ values must convey at least $\log k$ bits about $F$. Equivalently, if the mutual information between $F$ and side information $S$ satisfies $I(F;S)<\log k - \epsilon$, then the error probability for distinguishing the $k$-clique is bounded away from zero.
:::

::: proof
*Proof sketch.* Restrict $F$ to the $k$ values in the clique; this induces a uniform $k$-ary hypothesis testing problem. Apply the Fano-style bound (Theorem [\[thm:fano-converse\]](#thm:fano-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:fano-converse"} in Section [\[sec:info-converse\]](#sec:info-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:info-converse"}) to conclude that vanishing error requires $I(F;S)\ge\log k - o(1)$. If $I(F;S)$ is strictly smaller than $\log k$, Fano's inequality implies a non-zero lower bound on error probability. ◻
:::

The confusability graph provides a compact combinatorial certificate of necessary side-information: large cliques force large information requirements and hence constrain realizability in languages/environments with limited introspection or definition-time hooks.

## The Structural Timing Constraint {#sec:timing}

For certain classes of facts---*structural facts*---there is a fundamental timing constraint that shapes realizability.

::: definition
[]{#def:structural-fact-req label="def:structural-fact-req"} A fact $F$ is *structural* if its encoding locations are fixed at the moment of definition. After definition, the structure cannot be retroactively modified---only new structures can be created.
:::

**Examples across domains:**

-   **Programming languages**: Class definitions, method signatures, inheritance relationships

-   **Databases**: Schema definitions, table structures, foreign key constraints

-   **Configuration systems**: Resource declarations, dependency specifications

-   **Version control**: Branch structures, commit ancestry

The key property: structural facts have a *definition moment* after which their encoding is immutable. This creates a timing constraint for derivation.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:timing-forces label="thm:timing-forces"} For structural facts, derivation must occur at or before the moment the structure is fixed.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $F$ be a structural fact. Let $t_{\text{fix}}$ be the moment $F$'s encoding is fixed. Any derivation $D$ that depends on $F$ must execute at some time $t_D$.

**Case 1**: $t_D < t_{\text{fix}}$. Derivation executes before $F$ is fixed. $D$ cannot derive from $F$ because $F$ does not yet exist.

**Case 2**: $t_D > t_{\text{fix}}$. Derivation executes after $F$ is fixed. $D$ can read $F$ but cannot modify structures derived from $F$---they are already fixed.

**Case 3**: $t_D = t_{\text{fix}}$. Derivation executes at the moment $F$ is fixed. $D$ can both read $F$ and create derived structures before they are fixed.

Therefore, structural derivation requires $t_D = t_{\text{fix}}$. ◻
:::

This timing constraint is the information-theoretic reason why derivation must be *causal*---triggered by the act of defining the source, not by later access.

## Requirement 1: Causal Update Propagation {#sec:causal-propagation}

::: definition
[]{#def:causal-propagation label="def:causal-propagation"} An encoding system has *causal update propagation* if changes to a source location automatically trigger updates to all derived locations, without requiring explicit synchronization commands.

Formally: let $L_s$ be a source location and $L_d$ a derived location. The system has causal propagation iff: $$\text{update}(L_s, v) \Rightarrow \text{automatically\_updated}(L_d, f(v))$$ where $f$ is the derivation function. No separate "propagate" or "sync" operation is required.
:::

**Information-theoretic interpretation:** Causal propagation is analogous to *channel coding with feedback*. In classical channel coding, the encoder sends a message and waits for acknowledgment. With feedback, the encoder can immediately react to channel state. Causal propagation provides "feedback" from the definition event to the derivation mechanism---the encoder (source) and decoder (derived locations) are coupled in real-time.

**Connection to multi-version coding:** Rashmi et al. [@rashmi2015multiversion] formalize consistent distributed storage where updates to a source must propagate to replicas while maintaining consistency. Their "multi-version code" requires that any $c$ servers can decode the latest common version---a consistency guarantee analogous to our coherence requirement. Causal propagation is the mechanism by which this consistency is maintained under updates.

**Why causal propagation is necessary:**

Without causal propagation, there exists a temporal window between source modification and derived location update. During this window, the system is incoherent---the source and derived locations encode different values.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:causal-necessary label="thm:causal-necessary"} Achieving DOF = 1 for structural facts requires causal update propagation.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By Theorem [\[thm:timing-forces\]](#thm:timing-forces){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:timing-forces"}, structural derivation must occur at definition time. Without causal propagation, derived locations are not updated when the source is defined. This means:

1.  The source exists with value $v$

2.  Derived locations have not been updated; they either do not exist yet or hold stale values

3.  The system is temporarily incoherent

For DOF = 1, incoherence must be *impossible*, not merely transient. Causal propagation eliminates the temporal window: derived locations are updated *as part of* the source definition, not after.

Contrapositive: If an encoding system lacks causal propagation, DOF = 1 for structural facts is unrealizable. ◻
:::

**Realizations across domains:**

**Systems lacking causal propagation:**

-   **Java**: Annotations are metadata, not executable. No code runs at class definition.

-   **C++**: Templates expand at compile time but don't execute arbitrary user code.

-   **Go**: No hook mechanism. Interface satisfaction is implicit.

-   **Rust**: Proc macros run at compile time but generate static code, not runtime derivation.

## Requirement 2: Provenance Observability {#sec:provenance-observability}

::: definition
[]{#def:provenance-observability label="def:provenance-observability"} An encoding system has *provenance observability* if the system supports queries about derivation structure:

1.  What locations exist encoding a given fact?

2.  Which locations are sources vs. derived?

3.  What is the derivation relationship (which derived from which)?
:::

**Information-theoretic interpretation:** Provenance observability is the encoding-system analog of *side information at the decoder*. In Slepian-Wolf coding [@slepian1973noiseless], the decoder has access to correlated side information that enables decoding at rates below the source entropy. Provenance observability provides "side information" about the encoding structure itself---enabling verification that DOF = 1 holds.

Without provenance observability, the encoding system is a "black box"---you can read locations but cannot determine which are sources and which are derived. This makes DOF uncomputable from within the system.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:provenance-necessary label="thm:provenance-necessary"} Verifying that DOF = 1 holds requires provenance observability.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Verification of DOF = 1 requires confirming:

1.  All locations encoding fact $F$ are enumerable

2.  Exactly one location is independent (the source)

3.  All other locations are derived from that source

Step (1) requires querying what structures exist. Step (2) requires distinguishing sources from derived locations. Step (3) requires querying the derivation relationship.

Without provenance observability, none of these queries are answerable from within the system. DOF = 1 can hold but cannot be verified. Bugs in derivation logic go undetected until coherence violations manifest. ◻
:::

**Connection to coding theory:** In coding theory, a code's structure (generator matrix, parity-check matrix) must be known to the decoder. Provenance observability is analogous: the derivation structure must be queryable for verification.

**Realizations across domains:**

::: center
  **Domain**            **Provenance Observability Mechanism**

  Smalltalk             `subclasses`, `allSubclasses`
  Databases             System catalogs (`pg_depend`), query plan introspection
  Distributed systems   Vector clocks, provenance tracking, `etcd` watch
  Configuration         Terraform `graph`, Kubernetes API server
:::

**Systems lacking provenance observability:**

-   **C++**: Cannot query "what types instantiated template `Foo<T>`?"

-   **Rust**: Proc macro expansion is opaque at runtime.

-   **TypeScript**: Types are erased. Runtime cannot query type relationships.

-   **Go**: No type registry. Cannot enumerate interface implementations.

## Independence of Requirements {#sec:independence}

The two requirements---causal propagation and provenance observability---are independent. Neither implies the other.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:independence label="thm:independence"}

1.  An encoding system can have causal propagation without provenance observability

2.  An encoding system can have provenance observability without causal propagation
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* **(1) Causal without provenance:** Rust proc macros execute at compile time (causal propagation: definition triggers code generation). But the generated code is opaque at runtime---the program cannot query what was generated (no provenance observability).

**(2) Provenance without causal:** Java provides reflection (`Class.getMethods()`, `Class.getInterfaces()`)---provenance observability. But no code executes when a class is defined---no causal propagation. ◻
:::

This independence means both requirements must be satisfied for DOF = 1 realizability.

## The Realizability Theorem {#sec:realizability-theorem}

::: theorem
[]{#thm:ssot-iff label="thm:ssot-iff"} An encoding system $S$ can achieve verifiable DOF = 1 for structural facts if and only if:

1.  $S$ provides causal update propagation, AND

2.  $S$ provides provenance observability
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* $(\Rightarrow)$ **Necessity:** Suppose $S$ achieves verifiable DOF = 1 for structural facts.

-   By Theorem [\[thm:causal-necessary\]](#thm:causal-necessary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:causal-necessary"}, $S$ must provide causal propagation

-   By Theorem [\[thm:provenance-necessary\]](#thm:provenance-necessary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:provenance-necessary"}, $S$ must provide provenance observability

$(\Leftarrow)$ **Sufficiency:** Suppose $S$ provides both capabilities.

-   Causal propagation enables derivation at the right moment (when structure is fixed)

-   Provenance observability enables verification that all secondary encodings are derived

-   Therefore, DOF = 1 is achievable: create one source, derive all others causally, verify completeness via provenance queries

 ◻
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:dof-complete label="def:dof-complete"} An encoding system is *DOF-1-complete* if it satisfies both causal propagation and provenance observability. Otherwise it is *DOF-1-incomplete*.
:::

**Information-theoretic interpretation:** DOF-1-completeness is analogous to *channel capacity achievability*. A channel achieves capacity if there exist codes that approach the Shannon limit. An encoding system is DOF-1-complete if there exist derivation mechanisms that achieve the coherence-optimal rate (DOF = 1). The two requirements (causal propagation, provenance observability) are the "channel properties" that enable capacity achievement.

## Connection to Write-Once Memory Codes {#sec:wom-connection}

Our realizability requirements connect to *write-once memory (WOM) codes* [@rivest1982wom; @wolf1984wom], an established area of coding theory.

A WOM is a storage medium where bits can only transition in one direction (typically $0 \to 1$). Rivest and Shamir [@rivest1982wom] showed that WOMs can store more information than their apparent capacity by encoding multiple "writes" cleverly---the capacity for $t$ writes is $\log_2(t+1)$ bits per cell.

The connection to our framework:

-   **WOM constraint**: Bits can only increase (irreversible state change)

-   **Structural fact constraint**: Structure is fixed at definition (irreversible encoding)

-   **WOM coding**: Clever encoding enables multiple logical writes despite physical constraints

-   **DOF = 1 derivation**: Clever derivation enables multiple logical locations from one physical source

Both settings involve achieving optimal encoding under irreversibility constraints. WOM codes achieve capacity via coding schemes; DOF-1-complete systems achieve coherence via derivation mechanisms.

## The Logical Chain (Summary) {#sec:chain}

::: center
:::

**Every step is machine-checked in Lean 4.** The proofs compile with zero `sorry` placeholders.

## Concrete Impossibility Demonstration {#sec:impossibility}

We demonstrate exactly why DOF-1-incomplete systems cannot achieve DOF = 1 for structural facts.

**The structural fact:** "`PNGHandler` handles `.png` files."

This fact must be encoded in two places:

1.  The handler definition (where the handler is defined)

2.  The registry/dispatcher (where format$\to$handler mapping lives)

**Python (DOF-1-complete) achieves DOF = 1:**

::: code
class ImageHandler: \_registry =

def \_\_init_subclass\_\_(cls, format=None, \*\*kwargs): super().\_\_init_subclass\_\_(\*\*kwargs) if format: ImageHandler.\_registry\[format\] = cls \# DERIVED (causal)

class PNGHandler(ImageHandler, format=\"png\"): \# SOURCE def load(self, path): \...
:::

**Causal propagation:** When `class PNGHandler` executes, `__init_subclass__` fires immediately, adding the registry entry. No temporal gap.

**Provenance observability:** `ImageHandler.__subclasses__()` returns all handlers. The derivation structure is queryable.

**DOF = 1**: The `format="png"` in the class definition is the single source. The registry entry is derived causally. Adding a new handler requires changing exactly one location.

**Java (DOF-1-incomplete) cannot achieve DOF = 1:**

**No causal propagation:** The `@Handler` annotation is data, not code. Nothing executes when the class is defined.

**Provenance partially present:** Java has reflection, but cannot enumerate "all classes with `@Handler`" without classpath scanning.

**DOF = 2**: The annotation and the registry are independent encodings. Either can be modified without the other. Incoherence is reachable.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:generated-second label="thm:generated-second"} A generated source file constitutes an independent encoding, not a derivation. Code generation does not achieve DOF = 1.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $E_1$ be the annotation on `PNGHandler.java`. Let $E_2$ be the generated `HandlerRegistry.java`.

Test: If $E_2$ is deleted or modified, does system behavior change? **Yes**---the handler is not registered.

Test: Can $E_2$ diverge from $E_1$? **Yes**---$E_2$ is a separate file that can be edited, fail to generate, or be stale.

Therefore, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are independent encodings. The fact that $E_2$ was *generated from* $E_1$ does not make it derived in the DOF sense, because:

1.  $E_2$ exists as a separate artifact that can diverge

2.  The generation process is external to the runtime and can be bypassed

3.  There is no causal coupling---modification of $E_1$ does not automatically update $E_2$

Contrast with Python: the registry entry exists only in memory, created causally by the class statement. There is no second file. DOF = 1. ◻

# Corollary: Programming-Language Instantiation {#sec:evaluation}

We instantiate Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"} in the domain of programming languages. This section is a formal corollary of the realizability theorem: once a language's definition-time hooks and introspection capabilities are fixed, DOF = 1 realizability for structural facts is determined.

::: corollary
[]{#cor:lang-realizability label="cor:lang-realizability"} A programming language can realize DOF = 1 for structural facts iff it provides both (i) definition-time hooks and (ii) introspectable derivations. This is the direct instantiation of Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"}.
:::

**Instantiation map.** In the abstract model, an independent encoding is a location that can diverge under edits. In programming languages, structural facts are encoded at definition sites; *definition-time hooks* implement derivation (automatic propagation), and *introspection* implements provenance observability. Thus DEF corresponds to causal propagation and INTRO corresponds to queryable derivations; DOF = 1 is achievable exactly when both are present.

We instantiate this corollary over a representative language class (Definition [\[def:mainstream\]](#def:mainstream){reference-type="ref" reference="def:mainstream"}).

::: definition
[]{#def:mainstream label="def:mainstream"} A language is *mainstream* iff it appears in the top 20 of at least two of the following indices consistently over 5+ years:

1.  TIOBE Index [@tiobe2024] (monthly language popularity)

2.  Stack Overflow Developer Survey (annual)

3.  GitHub Octoverse (annual repository statistics)

4.  RedMonk Programming Language Rankings (quarterly)

## Evaluation Criteria {#sec:criteria}

The abstract realizability conditions (causal update propagation and provenance observability) map directly to concrete language capabilities (definition-time hooks and runtime introspection). For TIT readers we summarize this mapping here and defer the full language-by-language evaluation, extended code examples, and detailed rationale to Supplement A.

:::

**Interpretation.** DOF-1-complete languages can achieve DOF = 1 for structural facts using language-native mechanisms. DOF-1-incomplete languages require external tooling (code generation, IDE refactoring) which operates outside language semantics and can be bypassed (cf. Theorem [\[thm:independence\]](#thm:independence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:independence"} on why external tools do not establish derivation).

Supplement A contains the complete evaluation with justifications, worked code examples demonstrating each mechanism, and discussion of edge cases.


# Rate-Complexity Bounds {#sec:bounds}

We now prove the rate-complexity bounds that make DOF = 1 optimal. The key result: the gap between DOF-1-complete and DOF-1-incomplete architectures is *unbounded*---it grows without limit as encoding systems scale.

## Cost Model {#sec:cost-model}

::: definition
[]{#def:cost-model label="def:cost-model"} Let $\delta_F$ be a modification to fact $F$ in encoding system $C$. The *effective modification complexity* $M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F)$ is the number of syntactically distinct edit operations that must be performed manually. Formally: $$M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = |\{L \in \text{Locations}(C) : \text{requires\_manual\_edit}(L, \delta_F)\}|$$ where $\text{requires\_manual\_edit}(L, \delta_F)$ holds iff location $L$ must be updated manually (not by automatic derivation) to maintain coherence after $\delta_F$.
:::

**Unit of cost:** One edit = one syntactic modification to one location. We count locations, not keystrokes or characters. This abstracts over edit complexity to focus on the scaling behavior.

**What we measure:** Manual edits only. Derived locations that update automatically have zero cost. This distinguishes DOF = 1 systems (where derivation handles propagation) from DOF $>$ 1 systems (where all updates are manual).

**Asymptotic parameter:** We measure scaling in the number of encoding locations for fact $F$. Let $n = |\{L \in C : \text{encodes}(L, F)\}|$ and $k = \text{DOF}(C, F)$. Bounds of $O(1)$ and $\Omega(n)$ are in this parameter; in particular, the lower bound uses $n = k$ independent locations.

## Upper Bound: DOF = 1 Achieves O(1) {#sec:upper-bound}

::: theorem
[]{#thm:upper-bound label="thm:upper-bound"} For an encoding system with DOF = 1 for fact $F$: $$M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = O(1)$$ Effective modification complexity is constant regardless of system size.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$. By Definition [\[def:ssot\]](#def:ssot){reference-type="ref" reference="def:ssot"}, $C$ has exactly one independent encoding location. Let $L_s$ be this single independent location.

When $F$ changes:

1.  Update $L_s$ (1 manual edit)

2.  All derived locations $L_1, \ldots, L_k$ are automatically updated by the derivation mechanism

3.  Total manual edits: 1

The number of derived locations $k$ can grow with system size, but the number of *manual* edits remains 1. Therefore, $M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = O(1)$. ◻
:::

**Note on "effective" vs. "total" complexity:** Total modification complexity $M(C, \delta_F)$ counts all locations that change. Effective modification complexity counts only manual edits. With DOF = 1, total complexity can be $O(n)$ (many derived locations change), but effective complexity is $O(1)$ (one manual edit).

## Lower Bound: DOF $>$ 1 Requires $\Omega(n)$ {#sec:lower-bound}

::: theorem
[]{#thm:lower-bound label="thm:lower-bound"} For an encoding system with DOF $>$ 1 for fact $F$, if $F$ is encoded at $n$ independent locations: $$M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = \Omega(n)$$
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $\text{DOF}(C, F) = n$ where $n > 1$.

By Definition [\[def:independent\]](#def:independent){reference-type="ref" reference="def:independent"}, the $n$ encoding locations are independent---updating one does not automatically update the others. When $F$ changes:

1.  Each of the $n$ independent locations must be updated manually

2.  No automatic propagation exists between independent locations

3.  Total manual edits: $n$

Therefore, $M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = \Omega(n)$. ◻
:::

## Information-theoretic converse (mutual information / Fano) {#sec:info-converse}

To make the converse argument explicit in information-theoretic terms we give a concise mutual-information / Fano-style bound showing that insufficient side information forces a non-vanishing error probability when attempting to recover structural facts from distributed encodings.

::: remark
The results in this subsection apply Fano's inequality, a standard tool in information theory [@cover2006elements]. We state and apply these results without separate Lean formalization; the proofs are direct applications of the classical inequality. The core capacity and complexity theorems (Sections [\[sec:capacity\]](#sec:capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:capacity"}--[\[sec:requirements\]](#sec:requirements){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:requirements"}) are fully machine-checked.
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:fano-converse label="thm:fano-converse"} Let $F$ be a discrete fact taking values in a set of size $K$. Let $S$ denote the available side information (derived locations, observations). Let $\hat F(S)$ be any estimator of $F$ based on $S$, and let $P_e = \Pr(\hat F \neq F)$. Then $$I(F;S) \ge H(F) - H_b(P_e) - P_e\log(K-1),$$ where $H_b(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy. In particular, if $P_e\to 0$ then $I(F;S)\to H(F)$, so $S$ must contain essentially $\log K$ bits about $F$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof sketch.* This is the standard Fano inequality. Let $\hat F$ be any estimator formed from $S$. Then $$H(F|S) \le H(F|\hat F)+I(F;\hat F|S) = H(F|\hat F)\le H_b(P_e)+P_e\log(K-1),$$ and $I(F;S)=H(F)-H(F|S)$ yields the stated bound. The terms $H_b(P_e)$ and $P_e\log(K-1)$ vanish as $P_e\to0$, forcing $I(F;S)\approx H(F)$. ◻
:::

This inequality formalizes the intuition used in the main text: unless the derived/side-information channels collectively convey essentially the full entropy of the fact, perfect (or vanishing-error) recovery is impossible. Translating this to modification complexity shows that when side-information capacity is limited, systems must retain multiple independent encodings (higher DOF), incurring larger manual update costs.

## Information-constrained DOF lower bound {#sec:info-dof}

The following lemma makes the link explicit between mutual-information capacity of side information and the necessity of multiple independent encodings.

::: lemma
[]{#lem:info-dof label="lem:info-dof"} Let $F$ be a fact uniformly distributed over $K$ values. Let $S$ be the collective side information provided by derived locations. If $$I(F;S) < \log K - \delta$$ for some $\delta>0$, then any encoding system that guarantees vanishing-error recovery of $F$ from $S$ must include at least two independent encoding locations for some subset of values (i.e., DOF $>1$ for those values). Consequently, for facts encoded at $n$ independent locations the effective modification complexity satisfies $M_{\text{effective}}=\Omega(n)$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof sketch.* By Theorem [\[thm:fano-converse\]](#thm:fano-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:fano-converse"}, if $I(F;S)<\log K-\delta$ then any estimator has error probability bounded away from zero for the $K$-ary hypothesis. To achieve correctness despite the insufficient side information, the system must retain additional independent encodings that act as auxiliary sources of information about $F$; these independent encodings increase DOF. Once DOF$>1$ over a set of $n$ independent locations, Theorem [\[thm:lower-bound\]](#thm:lower-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:lower-bound"} implies $M_{\text{effective}}=\Omega(n)$, completing the chain from information constraints to modification complexity. ◻
:::

## Worked example: numeric mutual-information calculation {#sec:worked-mi}

Consider a fact $F$ uniformly distributed over $K=4$ values, so $H(F)=\log_2 4 = 2$ bits. Suppose the collective derived side information $S$ conveys only $I(F;S)=1$ bit about $F$ (for example, a summary or hash with one bit of mutual information).

Apply the Fano-style bound (Theorem [\[thm:fano-converse\]](#thm:fano-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:fano-converse"}). Let $P_e$ denote the probability of incorrect recovery of $F$ from $S$. Then $$H(F|S) = H(F)-I(F;S) = 2 - 1 = 1\text{ bit.}$$ Fano's inequality gives $$H_b(P_e) + P_e\log_2(K-1) \ge H(F|S) = 1.$$ Plugging $K-1=3$ and solving numerically yields a lower bound $P_e \gtrsim 0.19$ (approximately 19% error). Concretely: $H_b(0.19)\approx 0.695$ and $0.19\log_2 3\approx 0.301$, summing to $\approx 0.996\approx1$.

Interpretation: with only 1 bit of side information for a 2-bit fact, no estimator can recover $F$ with error lower than roughly 19%; therefore, to guarantee vanishing error one must supply more side information (increase $I(F;S)$) or retain extra independent encodings (increase DOF), which in turn raises manual modification costs per Theorem [\[thm:lower-bound\]](#thm:lower-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:lower-bound"}.

As a second illustration, if $I(F;S)=1.5$ bits then $H(F|S)=0.5$ and Fano's bound requires a much smaller $P_e$ (solve $H_b(P_e)+P_e\log_2 3\ge 0.5$ numerically to obtain $P_e\approx 0.08$), showing the smooth tradeoff between conveyed information and achievable error.

**Tightness (Achievability + Converse).** Theorems [\[thm:upper-bound\]](#thm:upper-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:upper-bound"} and [\[thm:lower-bound\]](#thm:lower-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:lower-bound"} form a tight information-theoretic bound: DOF = 1 achieves constant modification cost (achievability), while any encoding with more than one independent location incurs linear cost in the number of independent encodings (converse). There is no intermediate regime with sublinear manual edits when $k > 1$ independent encodings are permitted.

## The Unbounded Gap {#sec:gap}

::: theorem
[]{#thm:unbounded-gap label="thm:unbounded-gap"} The ratio of modification complexity between DOF-1-incomplete and DOF-1-complete architectures grows without bound: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{M_{\text{DOF}>1}(n)}{M_{\text{DOF}=1}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{1} = \infty$$
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By Theorem [\[thm:upper-bound\]](#thm:upper-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:upper-bound"}, $M_{\text{DOF}=1} = O(1)$. Specifically, $M_{\text{DOF}=1} = 1$ for any system size.

By Theorem [\[thm:lower-bound\]](#thm:lower-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:lower-bound"}, $M_{\text{DOF}>1}(n) = \Omega(n)$ where $n$ is the number of independent encoding locations.

The ratio is: $$\frac{M_{\text{DOF}>1}(n)}{M_{\text{DOF}=1}} = \frac{n}{1} = n$$

As $n \to \infty$, the ratio $\to \infty$. The gap is unbounded. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:arbitrary-reduction label="cor:arbitrary-reduction"} For any constant $k$, there exists a system size $n$ such that DOF = 1 provides at least $k\times$ reduction in modification complexity.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Choose $n = k$. Then $M_{\text{DOF}>1}(n) = n = k$ and $M_{\text{DOF}=1} = 1$. The reduction factor is $k/1 = k$. ◻

## The (R, C, P) Tradeoff Space {#sec:rcp-tradeoff}

We now formalize the complete tradeoff space, analogous to rate-distortion theory in classical information theory.

::: definition
[]{#def:rcp-tradeoff label="def:rcp-tradeoff"} For an encoding system, define:

-   $R$ = *Rate* (DOF): Number of independent encoding locations

-   $C$ = *Complexity*: Manual modification cost per change

-   $P$ = *Coherence indicator*: $P = 1$ iff no incoherent state is reachable; otherwise $P = 0$

The *(R, C, P) tradeoff space* is the set of achievable $(R, C, P)$ tuples.
:::

::::: theorem
[]{#thm:operating-regimes label="thm:operating-regimes"} The (R, C, P) space has three distinct operating regimes:

:::: center
::: tabularx
cccY **Rate** & **Complexity** & **Coherence** & **Interpretation**\
$R = 0$ & $C = 0$ & $P =$ undefined & Fact not encoded\
$R = 1$ & $C = O(1)$ & $P = 1$ & **Optimal (capacity-achieving)**\
$R > 1$ & $C = \Omega(R)$ & $P = 0$ & Above capacity\
:::
::::
:::::

::: proof
*Proof.* **$R = 0$:** No encoding exists. Complexity is zero (nothing to modify), but coherence is undefined (nothing to be coherent about).

**$R = 1$:** By Theorem [\[thm:upper-bound\]](#thm:upper-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:upper-bound"}, $C = O(1)$. By Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}, $P = 1$ (coherence guaranteed). This is the capacity-achieving regime.

**$R > 1$:** By Theorem [\[thm:lower-bound\]](#thm:lower-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:lower-bound"}, $C = \Omega(R)$. By Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"}, incoherent states are reachable, so $P = 0$. ◻
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:pareto-frontier label="def:pareto-frontier"} A point $(R, C, P)$ is *Pareto optimal* if no other achievable point dominates it (lower $R$, lower $C$, or higher $P$ without worsening another dimension).

The *Pareto frontier* is the set of all Pareto optimal points.
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:pareto-optimal label="thm:pareto-optimal"} $(R=1, C=1, P=1)$ is the unique Pareto optimal point for encoding systems requiring coherence ($P = 1$).
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* We show $(1, 1, 1)$ is Pareto optimal and unique:

**Existence:** By Theorems [\[thm:upper-bound\]](#thm:upper-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:upper-bound"} and [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}, the point $(1, 1, 1)$ is achievable.

**Optimality:** Consider any other achievable point $(R', C', P')$ with $P' = 1$:

-   If $R' = 0$: Fact is not encoded (excluded by requirement)

-   If $R' = 1$: Same as $(1, 1, 1)$ (by uniqueness of $C$ at $R=1$)

-   If $R' > 1$: By Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"}, $P' < 1$, contradicting $P' = 1$

**Uniqueness:** No other point achieves $P = 1$ except $R = 1$. ◻
:::

**Information-theoretic interpretation.** The Pareto frontier in rate-distortion theory is the curve $R(D)$ of minimum rate achieving distortion $D$. Here, the "distortion" is $1 - P$ (indicator of incoherence reachability), and the Pareto frontier collapses to a single point: $R = 1$ is the unique rate achieving $D = 0$.

::: corollary
[]{#cor:no-tradeoff label="cor:no-tradeoff"} Unlike rate-distortion where you can trade rate for distortion, there is no tradeoff at $P = 1$ (perfect coherence). The only option is $R = 1$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Direct consequence of Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}. ◻
:::

**Comparison to rate-distortion.** In rate-distortion theory:

-   You can achieve lower distortion with higher rate (more bits)

-   The rate-distortion function $R(D)$ is monotonically decreasing

-   $D = 0$ (lossless) requires $R = H(X)$ (source entropy)

In our framework:

-   You *cannot* achieve higher coherence ($P$) with more independent locations

-   Higher rate ($R > 1$) *eliminates* coherence guarantees ($P = 0$)

-   $P = 1$ (perfect coherence) requires $R = 1$ exactly

The key difference: redundancy (higher $R$) *hurts* rather than helps coherence (without coordination). This inverts the intuition from error-correcting codes, where redundancy enables error detection/correction. Here, redundancy without derivation enables errors (incoherence).

## Practical Implications {#sec:practical-implications}

The unbounded gap has practical implications:

**1. DOF = 1 matters more at scale.** For small systems ($n = 3$), the difference between 3 edits and 1 edit is minor. For large systems ($n = 50$), the difference between 50 edits and 1 edit is significant.

**2. The gap compounds over time.** Each modification to fact $F$ incurs the complexity cost. If $F$ changes $m$ times over the system lifetime, total cost is $O(mn)$ with DOF $>$ 1 vs. $O(m)$ with DOF = 1.

**3. The gap affects error rates.** Each manual edit is an opportunity for error. With $n$ edits, the probability of at least one error is $1 - (1-p)^n$ where $p$ is the per-edit error probability. As $n$ grows, this approaches 1.

:::: example
[]{#ex:error-rate label="ex:error-rate"} Assume a 1% error rate per edit ($p = 0.01$).

::: center
   **Edits ($n$)**   **P(at least one error)**   **Architecture**
  ----------------- --------------------------- ------------------
          1                    1.0%                  DOF = 1
         10                    9.6%                  DOF = 10
         50                    39.5%                 DOF = 50
         100                   63.4%                DOF = 100
:::

With 50 independent encoding locations (DOF = 50), there is a 39.5% chance of introducing an error when modifying fact $F$. With DOF = 1, the chance is 1%.
::::

## Amortized Analysis {#sec:amortized}

The complexity bounds assume a single modification. Over the lifetime of an encoding system, facts are modified many times.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:amortized label="thm:amortized"} Let fact $F$ be modified $m$ times over the system lifetime. Let $n$ be the number of independent encoding locations. Total modification cost is:

-   DOF = 1: $O(m)$

-   DOF = $n > 1$: $O(mn)$
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Each modification costs $O(1)$ with DOF = 1 and $O(n)$ with DOF = $n$. Over $m$ modifications, total cost is $m \cdot O(1) = O(m)$ with DOF = 1 and $m \cdot O(n) = O(mn)$ with DOF = $n$. ◻
:::

For a fact modified 100 times with 50 independent encoding locations:

-   DOF = 1: 100 edits total

-   DOF = 50: 5,000 edits total

The 50$\times$ reduction factor applies to every modification, compounding over the system lifetime.

Below we give a short summary and pointer to the supplement; the complete instantiation, PR traces, and verifiable diffs are available in Supplement A.

**Summary (short):**

-   Four recurring patterns realize DOF = 1: contract enforcement, automatic registration, automatic discovery, and introspection-driven code generation.

-   A publicly verifiable OpenHCS pull request (PR 44) demonstrates a 47$\to$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 DOF reduction; full diffs and measurements are in Supplement A.

-   The worked examples illustrate why both definition-time hooks and runtime introspection are necessary for DOF = 1; language-by-language impossibility notes are in Supplement A.

For the interested reader, Supplement A contains the complete before/after code, the methodology, measurement tables, and links to the public PR and repository snapshots.


# Related Work {#sec:related}

This section surveys related work across five areas: zero-error and multi-terminal source coding, interactive information theory, distributed systems, computational reflection, and formal methods.

## Zero-Error and Multi-Terminal Source Coding {#sec:related-source-coding}

Our zero-incoherence capacity theorem extends classical source coding to interactive multi-terminal systems.

**Zero-Error Capacity.** Shannon [@shannon1956zero] introduced zero-error capacity: the maximum rate achieving exactly zero error probability. Körner [@korner1973graphs] connected this to graph entropy, and Lovász [@lovasz1979shannon] characterized the Shannon capacity of the pentagon graph. Our zero-incoherence capacity is the storage analog: the maximum encoding rate achieving exactly zero incoherence probability. The achievability/converse structure (Theorems [\[thm:capacity-achievability\]](#thm:capacity-achievability){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-achievability"}, [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}) parallels zero-error proofs. The key parallel: zero-error capacity requires distinguishability between codewords; zero-incoherence capacity requires indistinguishability (all locations must agree).

**Multi-Terminal Source Coding.** Slepian and Wolf [@slepian1973noiseless] characterized distributed encoding of correlated sources: sources $(X, Y)$ can be encoded at rates satisfying $R_X \geq H(X|Y)$ when $Y$ is decoder side information. We model encoding locations as terminals (Section [\[sec:side-information\]](#sec:side-information){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:side-information"}). Derivation introduces *perfect correlation*: a derived terminal's output is a deterministic function of its source, so $H(L_d | L_s) = 0$. The capacity result shows that only complete correlation (all terminals derived from one source) achieves zero incoherence.

**Multi-Version Coding.** Rashmi et al. [@rashmi2015multiversion] formalize consistent distributed storage where multiple versions must be accessible while maintaining consistency. They prove an "inevitable price, in terms of storage cost, to ensure consistency." Our DOF = 1 theorem is analogous: we prove the *encoding rate* cost of ensuring coherence. Where multi-version coding trades storage for version consistency, we trade encoding rate for location coherence.

**Write-Once Memory Codes.** Rivest and Shamir [@rivest1982wom] introduced WOM codes for storage media where bits can only transition $0 \to 1$. Despite this irreversibility constraint, clever coding achieves capacity $\log_2(t+1)$ for $t$ writes---more than the naive $1$ bit.

Our structural facts have an analogous irreversibility: once defined, structure is fixed. The parallel:

-   **WOM:** Physical irreversibility (bits only increase) $\Rightarrow$ coding schemes maximize information per cell

-   **DOF = 1:** Structural irreversibility (definition is permanent) $\Rightarrow$ derivation schemes minimize independent encodings

Wolf [@wolf1984wom] extended WOM capacity results; our realizability theorem (Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"}) characterizes what encoding systems can achieve DOF = 1 under structural constraints.

**Classical Source Coding.** Shannon [@shannon1948mathematical] established source coding theory for static data. Slepian and Wolf [@slepian1973noiseless] extended to distributed sources with correlated side information, proving that joint encoding of $(X, Y)$ can achieve rate $H(X|Y)$ for $X$ when $Y$ is available at the decoder.

Our provenance observability requirement (Section [\[sec:provenance-observability\]](#sec:provenance-observability){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:provenance-observability"}) is the encoding-system analog: the decoder (verification procedure) has "side information" about the derivation structure, enabling verification of DOF = 1 without examining all locations independently.

**Rate-Distortion Theory.** Cover and Thomas [@cover2006elements] formalize the rate-distortion function $R(D)$: the minimum encoding rate to achieve distortion $D$. Our rate-complexity tradeoff (Theorem [\[thm:unbounded-gap\]](#thm:unbounded-gap){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:unbounded-gap"}) is analogous: encoding rate (DOF) trades against modification complexity. DOF = 1 achieves $O(1)$ complexity; DOF $> 1$ incurs $\Omega(n)$.

**Interactive Information Theory.** The BIRS workshop [@birs2012interactive] identified interactive information theory as an emerging area combining source coding, channel coding, and directed information. Ma and Ishwar [@ma2011distributed] showed that interaction can reduce rate for function computation. Xiang [@xiang2013interactive] studied interactive schemes including feedback channels.

Our framework extends this to *storage* rather than communication: encoding systems where the encoding itself is modified over time, requiring coherence maintenance.

**Minimum Description Length.** Rissanen [@rissanen1978mdl] established MDL: the optimal model minimizes total description length (model + data given model). Grünwald [@gruenwald2007mdl] proved uniqueness of MDL-optimal representations.

DOF = 1 is the MDL-optimal encoding for redundant facts: the single source is the model; derived locations have zero marginal description length (fully determined by source). Additional independent encodings add description length without reducing uncertainty---pure overhead. Our Theorem [\[thm:dof-optimal\]](#thm:dof-optimal){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-optimal"} establishes analogous uniqueness for encoding systems under modification constraints.

#### Closest prior work and novelty.

The closest IT lineage is multi-version coding and zero-error/interactive source coding. These settings address consistency or decoding with side information, but they do not model *modifiable* encodings with a coherence constraint over time. Our contribution is a formal encoding model with explicit modification operations, a coherence capacity theorem (unique rate for guaranteed coherence), an iff realizability characterization, and tight rate--complexity bounds.

## Distributed Systems Consistency {#sec:related-distributed}

We give formal encoding-theoretic versions of CAP and FLP in Section [\[sec:cap-flp\]](#sec:cap-flp){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:cap-flp"}. The connection is structural: CAP corresponds to the impossibility of coherence when replicated encodings remain independently updatable, and FLP corresponds to the impossibility of truth-preserving resolution in incoherent states without side information. Consensus protocols (Paxos [@lamport1998paxos], Raft [@ongaro2014raft]) operationalize this by enforcing coordination, which in our model corresponds to derivation (reducing DOF).

## Computational Reflection and Metaprogramming {#sec:related-meta}

**Metaobject protocols and reflection.** Kiczales et al. [@kiczales1991art] and Smith [@smith1984reflection] provide the classical foundations for systems that can execute code at definition time and introspect their own structure. These mechanisms correspond directly to causal propagation and provenance observability in our realizability theorem, explaining why MOP-equipped languages admit DOF = 1 for structural facts.

**Generative complexity.** Heering [@heering2015generative; @heering2003software] formalizes minimal generators for program families. DOF = 1 systems realize this minimal-generator viewpoint by construction: the single source is the generator and derived locations are generated instances.

## Software Engineering Principles {#sec:related-software}

Classical software-engineering principles such as DRY [@hunt1999pragmatic], information hiding [@parnas1972criteria], and code-duplication analyses [@fowler1999refactoring; @roy2007survey] motivate coherence and single-source design. Our contribution is not another guideline, but a formal encoding model and theorems that explain when such principles are forced by information constraints. These connections are interpretive; the proofs do not rely on SE assumptions.

## Formal Methods {#sec:related-formal}

Our Lean 4 [@demoura2021lean4] formalization follows the tradition of mechanized theory (e.g., Pierce [@pierce2002types], Winskel [@winskel1993semantics], CompCert [@leroy2009compcert]), but applies it to an information-theoretic encoding model.

## Novelty and IT Contribution {#sec:novelty}

To our knowledge, this is the first work to:

1.  **Define zero-incoherence capacity**---the maximum encoding rate guaranteeing zero probability of location disagreement, extending zero-error capacity to multi-location storage.

2.  **Prove a capacity theorem with achievability/converse**---$C_0 = 1$ exactly, with explicit achievability (Theorem [\[thm:capacity-achievability\]](#thm:capacity-achievability){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-achievability"}) and converse (Theorem [\[thm:capacity-converse\]](#thm:capacity-converse){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:capacity-converse"}) following the Shannon proof structure.

3.  **Quantify side information for resolution**---$\geq \log_2 k$ bits for $k$-way incoherence (Theorem [\[thm:side-info\]](#thm:side-info){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:side-info"}), connecting to Slepian-Wolf decoder side information.

4.  **Characterize encoder realizability**---causal propagation (feedback) and provenance observability (side information) are necessary and sufficient for achieving capacity (Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"}).

5.  **Establish rate-complexity tradeoffs**---$O(1)$ at capacity vs. $\Omega(n)$ above capacity, with unbounded gap (Theorem [\[thm:unbounded-gap\]](#thm:unbounded-gap){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:unbounded-gap"}).

# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

We have established a new capacity theorem extending zero-error source coding to interactive multi-location encoding systems. The key contributions are:

**1. Zero-Incoherence Capacity Theorem:** We define zero-incoherence capacity $C_0$ as the maximum encoding rate guaranteeing zero probability of location disagreement, and prove $C_0 = 1$ exactly (Theorem [\[thm:coherence-capacity\]](#thm:coherence-capacity){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:coherence-capacity"}). The proof follows the achievability/converse structure of Shannon's channel capacity theorem.

**2. Side Information Bound:** We prove that resolution of $k$-way incoherence requires $\geq \log_2 k$ bits of side information (Theorem [\[thm:side-info\]](#thm:side-info){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:side-info"}). This connects to Slepian-Wolf distributed source coding: provenance information acts as decoder side information.

**3. Multi-Terminal Interpretation:** We model encoding locations as terminals in a multi-terminal source coding problem. Derivation introduces perfect correlation (deterministic dependence), reducing effective rate. Only complete correlation (all terminals derived from one source) achieves zero incoherence.

**4. Rate-Complexity Tradeoffs:** We establish tradeoffs analogous to rate-distortion: $O(1)$ modification complexity at capacity vs. $\Omega(n)$ above capacity. The gap is unbounded (Theorem [\[thm:unbounded-gap\]](#thm:unbounded-gap){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:unbounded-gap"}).

**5. Encoder Realizability:** Achieving capacity requires two encoder properties: causal propagation (analogous to feedback) and provenance observability (analogous to decoder side information). Both necessary; together sufficient (Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"}).

**Corollary instantiations.** The abstract theory instantiates across domains (programming languages, distributed databases, configuration systems). Sections [\[sec:evaluation\]](#sec:evaluation){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:evaluation"} and [\[sec:empirical\]](#sec:empirical){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:empirical"} provide illustrative corollaries; the core theorems are domain-independent.

**Implications:**

1.  **For information theorists:** Zero-error capacity theory extends to interactive multi-location encoding. The setting (modifiable encodings, coherence constraints) is new; the achievability/converse structure and side information bounds connect to established IT.

2.  **For coding theorists:** Derivation is the mechanism that introduces correlation, reducing effective encoding rate. The encoder realizability theorem characterizes what encoder properties enable capacity-achieving codes.

3.  **For system designers:** The capacity theorem is a forcing result: if coherence is required, encoding rate must be $\leq 1$. Systems operating above capacity require external side information for resolution.

**Limitations:**

-   Results apply primarily to facts with modification constraints. Streaming data and high-frequency updates have different characteristics.

-   The complexity bounds are asymptotic. For small encoding systems (DOF $< 5$), the asymptotic gap is numerically small.

-   Computational realization examples are primarily from software systems. The theory is general, but database and configuration system case studies are limited to canonical examples.

-   Realizability requirements focus on computational systems. Physical and biological encoding systems require separate analysis.

**Future Work:**

-   **Probabilistic coherence:** Extend to soft constraints where incoherence probability is bounded but non-zero, analogous to the transition from zero-error to vanishing-error capacity.

-   **Network encoding:** Study coherence capacity in networked encoding systems with communication constraints, connecting to network information theory.

-   **Rate-distortion extension:** Characterize the full rate-complexity function $R(M)$ trading encoding rate against modification complexity, analogous to rate-distortion $R(D)$.

-   **Interactive capacity:** Study capacity under multi-round modification protocols, connecting to interactive information theory and directed information.

-   **Partial correlation:** Characterize coherence guarantees when derivation introduces partial (non-deterministic) correlation, extending beyond the perfect-correlation case.

3.  The build verifies all 441 theorems; there are no `sorry` placeholders.

## Proof Architecture {#proof-architecture .unnumbered}

The formalization grounds the abstract encoding theory in operational semantics:

-   **Core definitions** (`SSOT.lean`): DOF as `Nat`, `satisfies_SSOT dof := dof = 1`

-   **Coherence** (`Coherence.lean`): `EncodingSystem` with `is_coherent`/`is_incoherent` predicates; achievability and converse proofs

-   **Timing trichotomy** (`Foundations.lean`): `TimingRelation` type with exhaustiveness proof; derivation mechanism enumeration

-   **Realizability** (`Requirements.lean`): `LanguageFeatures` structure; necessity proofs for definition hooks and introspection

-   **Impossibility** (`Foundations.lean`): Constructive witnesses showing only `source_hooks` achieves SSOT

The key insight: computational system claims (e.g., "Python achieves DOF = 1") derive from formalized operational semantics, not boolean flags. The proof chain traces from abstract theorems through `execute_class_statement` to concrete language features.

Full listings, the model correspondence argument, and detailed proof commentary are in Supplement A.

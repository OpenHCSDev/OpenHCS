## Abstract

**Epistemic Foundation.** Any system encoding facts faces a fundamental constraint: when multiple independent locations encode the same fact, truth becomes indeterminate. We prove that DOF = 1 (Single Source of Truth) is the unique representation guaranteeing coherence---the impossibility of disagreement among encodings.

**The Core Theorem (Oracle Arbitrariness).** In any incoherent encoding system (DOF $> 1$ with divergent values), no resolution is principled: for ANY oracle claiming to identify the "true" value, there exists an equally-present value that disagrees. This is not about inconvenience. It is about the determinacy of truth.

**Software as Instance.** Programming languages instantiate this epistemic structure:

-   Encoding systems $\to$ Codebases

-   Facts $\to$ Structural specifications (class existence, method signatures)

-   Coherence $\to$ Consistency across encoding locations

-   DOF = 1 $\to$ Single Source of Truth (DRY principle)

We prove that achieving DOF = 1 for structural facts requires specific language features: definition-time hooks AND introspectable derivation. Most mainstream languages (Java, C++, Rust, Go, TypeScript, etc.) lack these features and **cannot achieve coherence** for structural facts regardless of programmer effort.

**Four Theorems:**

1.  **Coherence Forcing (Theorem [\[thm:dof-optimal\]](#thm:dof-optimal){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-optimal"}):** DOF = 1 is the unique value guaranteeing coherence. DOF = 0 means the fact is unrepresented; DOF $> 1$ permits incoherent states.

2.  **Oracle Arbitrariness (Theorem [\[thm:oracle-arbitrary\]](#thm:oracle-arbitrary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:oracle-arbitrary"}):** Under incoherence, any resolution is arbitrary---no oracle is justified by the encodings alone.

3.  **Language Requirements (Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"}):** For structural facts in software, DOF = 1 requires definition-time hooks AND introspection. These are logically forced.

4.  **Strict Dominance (Theorem [\[thm:unbounded-gap\]](#thm:unbounded-gap){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:unbounded-gap"}):** The coherence restoration complexity gap is unbounded: $O(1)$ vs $\Omega(n)$.

**Theoretical Foundation.** The derivation theory (independence, derivability, axis collapse) is established in Paper 1 [@paper1_typing_discipline]. This paper proves the coherence consequences and instantiates them to programming languages.

All theorems machine-checked in Lean 4 (9,351 lines, 541 theorems, 0 `sorry`). Language capability claims derived from formalized operational semantics, not declared. Practical demonstration via OpenHCS [@openhcs2025] PR #44 [@openhcsPR44]: migration from 47 scattered checks to 1 ABC (DOF 47 $\to$ 1).

# Introduction

## The Epistemic Problem {#sec:epistemic-problem}

When multiple locations encode the same fact, which location holds the truth?

This question has no principled answer. If location $L_1$ says "threshold = 0.5" and location $L_2$ says "threshold = 0.7", no information internal to the encoding system determines which is correct. Any resolution is arbitrary---it requires external information (developer intent, timestamps, priority rules) that the encodings themselves do not contain.

This is not a software engineering problem. It is an **epistemic** problem: the determinacy of truth under redundant encoding.

> **Oracle Arbitrariness Theorem.** For any incoherent encoding system and any oracle that resolves it to a value, there exists an equally-present value that disagrees with the oracle's choice.

The theorem is proved formally (Theorem [\[thm:oracle-arbitrary\]](#thm:oracle-arbitrary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:oracle-arbitrary"}). Its consequence: **DOF = 1 is epistemically necessary** for coherent representation. With exactly one independent source, disagreement is impossible. Truth is determinate.

## Software as Instance {#sec:software-instance}

Programming languages instantiate this epistemic structure. A codebase is an encoding system. Structural facts (class existence, method signatures, type relationships) are the facts being encoded. The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle [@hunt1999pragmatic] is the software engineering recognition of epistemic necessity.

This paper proves:

1.  **The epistemic foundation:** DOF = 1 is the unique representation guaranteeing coherence

2.  **The software instantiation:** Achieving DOF = 1 for structural facts requires specific language features

3.  **The impossibility result:** Most mainstream languages lack these features and cannot achieve coherence

## Metatheoretic Foundations

Following the tradition of formal language design criteria (Liskov & Wing [@liskov1994behavioral] for subtyping; Cook et al. [@cook1989inheritance] for inheritance semantics), we formalize correctness criteria for SSOT-completeness in programming languages. Our contribution is not advocating specific languages, but deriving the necessary and sufficient requirements that enable Single Source of Truth for structural facts.

The derivation theory (independence, derivability, axis collapse) is established in Paper 1 [@paper1_typing_discipline]. This paper proves the coherence consequences and instantiates them to programming languages.

## The Universal Principle {#sec:universal-principle}

This paper proves an epistemic result that applies beyond programming:

1.  **DOF = 1 guarantees coherence.** With exactly one independent encoding, disagreement is impossible. Truth is determinate.

2.  **DOF $> 1$ permits incoherence.** With multiple independent encodings, disagreeing states are reachable. Truth becomes indeterminate.

3.  **DOF = 1 is uniquely optimal.** DOF = 0 means the fact is unrepresented. DOF $> 1$ permits incoherence. Only DOF = 1 achieves coherent representation.

**The forcing theorem.** Given coherence as a requirement, DOF = 1 is the unique solution. We do not claim all systems require coherence. We prove that systems requiring coherence have no design freedom---the solution is forced.

**The language instantiation.** For *structural facts* in programming languages, DOF = 1 requires specific language features: definition-time hooks and introspection. Languages lacking either *cannot achieve* DOF = 1 for structural facts regardless of programmer effort. This is an impossibility result (Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"}).

The epistemic principle is universal. The language evaluation is its instantiation to software. Both are machine-checked.

## Overview

This paper establishes **coherence impossibility theorems** for programming languages: we prove that most mainstream languages **cannot guarantee coherence** for structural facts. All results are machine-checked in Lean 4 [@demoura2021lean4] (2,104 lines across 13 files, 0 `sorry` placeholders).

**Incompleteness.** We prove that Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, Go, Rust, TypeScript, Kotlin, and Swift lack the semantic machinery to achieve DOF = 1 (coherent representation) for structural facts. This is not a limitation of particular implementations. It is a fundamental property of their language semantics: incoherent states are always reachable.

**Completeness.** We prove that Python, Common Lisp (CLOS), and Smalltalk possess the necessary semantic features. Among mainstream languages (top-10 TIOBE, consistent 5+ year presence), Python is unique in this capability.

**Connection to software engineering practice.** The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle [@hunt1999pragmatic], articulated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system" (Hunt & Thomas, 1999), is the practitioner's recognition of epistemic necessity. We prove DRY reduces to DOF = 1, which is the unique coherent representation (Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"}). To our knowledge, this is the first formalization of DRY/SSOT as an epistemic requirement.

**Note on terminology:** The term "Single Source of Truth" also appears in data management literature, referring to authoritative data repositories. Our usage is distinct: we mean SSOT for *program structure* (class existence, method signatures, type relationships), not for data storage.

The core insight: coherence for *structural facts* requires language features that most mainstream languages lack:

1.  **Definition-time hooks** (Theorem [\[thm:hooks-necessary\]](#thm:hooks-necessary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:hooks-necessary"}): Code must execute when a class/function is *defined*, not when it is *used*. This enables derivation at the moment structure is established.

2.  **Introspectable derivation** (Theorem [\[thm:introspection-necessary\]](#thm:introspection-necessary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:introspection-necessary"}): The program must be able to query what was derived and from what. This enables verification of the derivation relationship.

3.  **Both are necessary** (Theorem [\[thm:independence\]](#thm:independence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:independence"}): Neither feature alone suffices. Without both, independent locations remain, and incoherence is possible.

These requirements are **information-theoretic**: Languages lacking either capability cannot eliminate independent locations regardless of programmer effort.

## Core Theorems {#sec:core-theorems}

We establish four theorems characterizing coherence achievability:

1.  **Theorem [\[thm:oracle-arbitrary\]](#thm:oracle-arbitrary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:oracle-arbitrary"} (Oracle Arbitrariness):** In any incoherent encoding system, no resolution is principled. For any oracle selecting a value, there exists an equally-present value that disagrees.

    *Proof technique:* By incoherence, at least two values exist. Any selection leaves the other disagreeing.

2.  **Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"} (Coherence Forcing):** DOF = 1 guarantees coherence. With exactly one independent source, disagreement is impossible.

    *Proof technique:* All other locations are derived (cannot diverge). Single source determines all values.

3.  **Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"} (Language Requirements):** A language enables DOF = 1 for structural facts if and only if it provides (1) definition-time hooks AND (2) introspectable derivation.

    *Proof technique:* Necessity by exhibiting incoherent states when either is missing. Sufficiency by construction.

4.  **Theorem [\[thm:unbounded-gap\]](#thm:unbounded-gap){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:unbounded-gap"} (Coherence Restoration Gap):** The complexity of restoring coherence after modification is unbounded: $O(1)$ for DOF = 1 vs $\Omega(n)$ for DOF $= n > 1$.

    *Proof technique:* Asymptotic analysis: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{1} = \infty$.

**Forced solution.** Given coherence as a requirement, DOF = 1 is the unique solution (Corollary [\[cor:coherence-forces-ssot\]](#cor:coherence-forces-ssot){reference-type="ref" reference="cor:coherence-forces-ssot"}). Language selection becomes **determined**: incomplete languages cannot achieve coherence regardless of implementation effort. This is not preference. It is epistemic necessity.

## Scope {#sec:scope}

This work characterizes SSOT for *structural facts* (class existence, method signatures, type relationships) within *single-language* systems. The complexity analysis is asymptotic, applying to systems where $n$ grows. External tooling can approximate SSOT behavior but operates outside language semantics.

**Multi-language systems.** When a system spans multiple languages (e.g., Python backend + TypeScript frontend + protobuf schemas), cross-language SSOT requires external code generation tools. The analysis in this paper characterizes single-language SSOT; multi-language SSOT is noted as future work (Section [\[sec:conclusion\]](#sec:conclusion){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:conclusion"}).

-   Theorem [\[thm:hooks-necessary\]](#thm:hooks-necessary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:hooks-necessary"}: Definition-time hooks are necessary

-   Theorem [\[thm:unbounded-gap\]](#thm:unbounded-gap){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:unbounded-gap"}: The gap is unbounded

**6. Practical demonstration (Section [\[sec:empirical\]](#sec:empirical){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:empirical"}):**

-   Before/after examples from OpenHCS (production Python codebase)

-   PR #44 [@openhcsPR44]: Migration from 47 scattered checks to 1 ABC (DOF 47 $\to$ 1)

-   Empirical validation that coherence is achievable in practice

## Empirical Context: OpenHCS {#sec:openhcs-context}

**What it does:** OpenHCS [@openhcs2025] is an open-source bioimage analysis platform for high-content screening (45K LoC Python). It processes microscopy images through configurable pipelines, with GUI-based design and Python code export. The system requires:

-   Automatic registration of analysis components

-   Type-safe configuration with inheritance

-   Runtime enumeration of available processors

-   Provenance tracking for reproducibility

**Why it matters for this paper:** OpenHCS requires SSOT for structural facts. When a new image processor is added (by subclassing `BaseProcessor`), it must automatically appear in:

-   The GUI component palette

-   The configuration schema

-   The serialization registry

-   The documentation generator

Without SSOT, adding a processor requires updating 4+ locations. With SSOT, only the class definition is needed. Python's `__init_subclass__` and `__subclasses__()` handle the rest.

**Key finding:** PR #44 [@openhcsPR44] migrated from duck typing (`hasattr()` checks) to nominal typing (ABC contracts). This eliminated 47 scattered checks, reducing DOF from 47 to 1. The migration validates both:

1.  The theoretical prediction: DOF reduction is achievable

2.  The practical benefit: Maintenance cost decreased measurably

## Decision Procedure, Not Preference {#sec:decision}

The contribution of this paper is not the theorems alone, but their consequence: *language selection for coherent representation becomes a decision procedure*.

Given coherence as a requirement:

1.  DOF = 1 is necessary (Corollary [\[cor:coherence-forces-ssot\]](#cor:coherence-forces-ssot){reference-type="ref" reference="cor:coherence-forces-ssot"})

2.  DOF = 1 for structural facts requires definition-time hooks AND introspection (Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"})

3.  Languages lacking these features cannot achieve coherence for structural facts

**Implications:**

1.  **Language design.** Future languages should include definition-time hooks and introspection if coherent structural representation is a design goal.

2.  **Architecture.** When coherence is required, language selection is constrained. "I prefer Go" is not valid when structural coherence is required.

3.  **Tooling.** External tools can work around language limitations but operate outside language semantics.

4.  **Pedagogy.** DRY should be taught as epistemic necessity with language requirements, not as a vague guideline.

Appendix [\[sec:lean\]](#sec:lean){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:lean"} contains complete Lean 4 proof listings.

## Anticipated Objections {#sec:objection-summary}

Before proceeding, we address objections readers are likely forming. Each is refuted in detail in Appendix [\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"}; here we summarize the key points.

#### "The model doesn't capture real Python/Rust semantics."

The model is validated through instantiation proofs (§[\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"}, Part I). `PythonInstantiation.lean` proves that all Python observables factor through the (B, S) axes. `LangPython.lean` directly encodes Python's datamodel specification. The model is falsifiable: produce Python code where two types with identical `__bases__` and `__dict__` behave differently, or where `__init_subclass__` fails to fire.

#### "Rust can achieve SSOT with proc macros and static registries."

No. Proc macros are per-item isolated---they cannot see other items during expansion. Registration is bypassable: you can `impl Trait` without any `#[derive]` annotation. The `inventory` crate uses linker tricks external to language semantics. Contrast Python: `__init_subclass__` fires automatically and *cannot be bypassed*. This is enforcement vs. enablement (§[\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"}, Part III).

#### "The requirements are circular---you define structural facts as fixed at definition time, then prove you need definition-time hooks."

No. We define structural facts by their *syntactic locus* (encoded in type definitions). The observation that they are fixed at definition time is a *consequence* of this locus. The theorem that hooks are required is *derived* from the observation. The circularity objection mistakes consequence for premise (§[\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"}, Part II).

#### "Build.rs / external tools can achieve SSOT."

External tools operate outside language semantics. They can fail, be misconfigured, or be bypassed. They provide no runtime verification---the program cannot confirm derivation occurred. Build tool configuration becomes a second source (DOF $\geq$ 2). This approximates SSOT but does not achieve it (§[\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"}, Parts II--III).

#### "The DOF = 1 definition is too restrictive."

The definition is *derived*, not chosen. DOF = 0 means the fact is unrepresented. DOF $> 1$ means multiple sources can diverge. DOF = 1 is the unique optimal point. Systems with DOF $> 1$ may be pragmatically acceptable but do not satisfy SSOT (§[\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"}, Part II).

#### "You just need discipline, not language features."

Discipline *is* the external oracle. The theorem states: with DOF $> 1$, consistency requires an external oracle. "Code review and documentation" are exactly that oracle---human-maintained, fallible, bypassable. Language enforcement cannot be forgotten; human discipline can (§[\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"}, Part IV).

#### "The proofs are trivial (`rfl`)."

When modeling is correct, theorems become definitional. This is a feature. Not all proofs are `rfl`: `rust_lacks_introspection` is 40 lines of actual reasoning. The contribution is making the right definitions so that consequences follow structurally (§[\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"}, Part V).

**If you have an objection not listed above,** check Appendix [\[sec:rebuttals\]](#sec:rebuttals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rebuttals"} (16 objections addressed) before concluding it has not been considered.


# Formal Foundations {#sec:foundations}

We establish the epistemic foundations of representation theory, then instantiate them to software. The core insight: SSOT is not a software engineering guideline but an epistemic necessity for coherent representation of facts.

## Epistemic Foundations {#sec:epistemic}

Before formalizing codebases and edits, we establish the epistemic structure that underlies all representation systems.

::: definition
[]{#def:encoding-system label="def:encoding-system"} An *encoding system* for a fact $F$ is a collection of locations $\{L_1, \ldots, L_n\}$, each capable of holding a value for $F$.
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:coherence label="def:coherence"} An encoding system is *coherent* iff all locations hold the same value: $$\forall i, j: \text{value}(L_i) = \text{value}(L_j)$$
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:incoherence label="def:incoherence"} An encoding system is *incoherent* iff some locations disagree: $$\exists i, j: \text{value}(L_i) \neq \text{value}(L_j)$$
:::

**The Epistemic Problem.** When an encoding system is incoherent, which value is "true"? This question has no answer internal to the system.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:oracle-arbitrary label="thm:oracle-arbitrary"} For any incoherent encoding system $S$ and any oracle $O$ that resolves $S$ to a value $v \in S$, there exists a value $v' \in S$ such that $v' \neq v$.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By incoherence, $\exists v_1, v_2 \in S: v_1 \neq v_2$. Either $O$ picks $v_1$ (then $v_2$ disagrees) or $O$ doesn't pick $v_1$ (then $v_1$ disagrees). ◻
:::

**Interpretation.** This theorem is not about difficulty---it is about *indeterminacy*. Under incoherence, the encoding system does not determine which value is true. Any resolution requires information external to the encodings.

::: definition
[]{#def:dof-epistemic label="def:dof-epistemic"} The *degrees of freedom* (DOF) of an encoding system is the number of locations that can be modified independently.
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:dof-one-coherence label="thm:dof-one-coherence"} If DOF = 1, then the encoding system is coherent in all reachable states.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* With DOF = 1, exactly one location is independent. All other locations are derived (automatically updated when the source changes). Derived locations cannot diverge from their source. Therefore, all locations hold the value determined by the single independent source. Disagreement is impossible. ◻
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence label="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"} If DOF $> 1$, then incoherent states are reachable.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* With DOF $> 1$, at least two locations are independent. Independent locations can be modified separately. A sequence of edits can set $L_1 = v_1$ and $L_2 = v_2$ where $v_1 \neq v_2$. This is an incoherent state. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:coherence-forces-ssot label="cor:coherence-forces-ssot"} If coherence must be guaranteed (no incoherent states reachable), then DOF = 1 is necessary and sufficient.
:::

This is the epistemic foundation of SSOT.

**Information-Theoretic Interpretation.** The DOF = 1 condition has a precise information-theoretic characterization. Rissanen's Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle [@rissanen1978mdl] states that the optimal representation minimizes total description length: $|$model$|$ + $|$data given model$|$. When DOF = 1, the single source *is* the minimal model; all derived locations are the "data given model" with zero additional description length (they are fully determined). When DOF $> 1$, the redundant independent locations require explicit synchronization---additional description length that serves no epistemic purpose. Grünwald [@gruenwald2007mdl] provides a comprehensive treatment showing that MDL-optimal representations are unique under mild conditions---precisely what Theorem [\[thm:dof-optimal\]](#thm:dof-optimal){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-optimal"} establishes for DOF.

Heering [@heering2015generative] formalized this connection for software specifically: the *generative complexity* of a program family is the length of the shortest generator. SSOT architectures achieve minimal generative complexity by construction---the single source is the generator, and derived locations are the generated instances. This framing connects our formalization to Kolmogorov complexity theory while remaining constructive (we provide the generator, not just prove its existence).

The following sections instantiate these concepts to software.

## Software Instantiation: Codebases {#sec:edit-space}

::: definition
A *codebase* $C$ is a finite collection of source files, each containing a sequence of syntactic constructs (classes, functions, statements, expressions).
:::

::: definition
A *location* $L \in C$ is a syntactically identifiable region of code: a class definition, a function body, a configuration value, a type annotation, etc.
:::

::: definition
For a codebase $C$, the *edit space* $E(C)$ is the set of all syntactically valid modifications to $C$. Each edit $\delta \in E(C)$ transforms $C$ into a new codebase $C' = \delta(C)$.
:::

The edit space is large (exponential in codebase size). But we are not interested in arbitrary edits. We are interested in edits that *change a specific fact*.

## Facts: Atomic Units of Specification {#sec:facts}

::: definition
[]{#def:fact label="def:fact"} A *fact* $F$ is an atomic unit of program specification: a single piece of knowledge that can be independently modified. Facts are the indivisible units of meaning in a specification.
:::

The granularity of facts is determined by the specification, not the implementation. If two pieces of information must always change together, they constitute a single fact. If they can change independently, they are separate facts.

**Examples of facts:**

::: center
  **Fact**                                           **Description**
  -------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------
  $F_1$: "threshold = 0.5"                           A configuration value
  $F_2$: "`PNGLoader` handles `.png`"                A type-to-handler mapping
  $F_3$: "`validate()` returns `bool`"               A method signature
  $F_4$: "`Detector` is a subclass of `Processor`"   An inheritance relationship
  $F_5$: "`Config` has field `name: str`"            A dataclass field
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:structural-fact label="def:structural-fact"} A fact $F$ is *structural* with respect to codebase $C$ iff the locations encoding $F$ are syntactic constituents of type definitions: $$\text{structural}(F, C) \Longleftrightarrow \forall L: \text{encodes}(L, F) \rightarrow L \in \text{TypeSyntax}(C)$$ where $\text{TypeSyntax}(C)$ comprises class declarations, method signatures, inheritance clauses, and attribute definitions.
:::

**Key property:** Structural facts are fixed at *definition time*. Once a class is defined, its structure (methods, bases, attributes) cannot change without redefining the class. This is why structural SSOT requires definition-time hooks: the encoding locations are only mutable during class creation.

**Non-structural facts** (configuration values, runtime state) have encoding locations outside type syntax. They can be modified at runtime without redefining types. SSOT for non-structural facts requires different mechanisms (e.g., reactive bindings, event systems) and is outside the scope of this paper.

## Encoding: The Correctness Relationship {#sec:encoding}

::: definition
[]{#def:encodes label="def:encodes"} Location $L$ *encodes* fact $F$, written $\text{encodes}(L, F)$, iff correctness requires updating $L$ when $F$ changes.

Formally: $$\text{encodes}(L, F) \Longleftrightarrow \forall \delta_F: \neg\text{updated}(L, \delta_F) \rightarrow \text{incorrect}(\delta_F(C))$$

where $\delta_F$ is an edit targeting fact $F$.
:::

**Key insight:** This definition is **forced** by correctness, not chosen. We do not decide what encodes what. Correctness requirements determine it. If failing to update location $L$ when fact $F$ changes produces an incorrect program, then $L$ encodes $F$. This is an objective, observable property.

::: example
[]{#ex:encoding label="ex:encoding"} Consider a type registry:

    # Location L1: Class definition
    class PNGLoader(ImageLoader):
        format = "png"

    # Location L2: Registry entry
    LOADERS = {"png": PNGLoader, "jpg": JPGLoader}

    # Location L3: Documentation
    # Supported formats: png, jpg

The fact $F$ = "`PNGLoader` handles `png`" is encoded at:

-   $L_1$: The class definition (primary encoding)

-   $L_2$: The registry dictionary (secondary encoding)

-   $L_3$: The documentation comment (tertiary encoding)

If $F$ changes (e.g., to "`PNGLoader` handles `png` and `apng`"), all three locations must be updated for correctness. The program is incorrect if $L_2$ still says `{"png": PNGLoader}` when the class now handles both formats.

## Modification Complexity {#sec:mod-complexity}

::: definition
[]{#def:mod-complexity label="def:mod-complexity"} $$M(C, \delta_F) = |\{L \in C : \text{encodes}(L, F)\}|$$ The number of locations that must be updated when fact $F$ changes.
:::

Modification complexity is the central metric of this paper. It measures the *cost* of changing a fact. A codebase with $M(C, \delta_F) = 47$ requires 47 edits to correctly implement a change to fact $F$. A codebase with $M(C, \delta_F) = 1$ requires only 1 edit.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:correctness-forcing label="thm:correctness-forcing"} $M(C, \delta_F)$ is the **minimum** number of edits required for correctness. Fewer edits imply an incorrect program.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Suppose $M(C, \delta_F) = k$, meaning $k$ locations encode $F$. By Definition [\[def:encodes\]](#def:encodes){reference-type="ref" reference="def:encodes"}, each encoding location must be updated when $F$ changes. If only $j < k$ locations are updated, then $k - j$ locations still reflect the old value of $F$. These locations create inconsistencies:

1.  The specification says $F$ has value $v'$ (new)

2.  Locations $L_1, \ldots, L_j$ reflect $v'$

3.  Locations $L_{j+1}, \ldots, L_k$ reflect $v$ (old)

By Definition [\[def:encodes\]](#def:encodes){reference-type="ref" reference="def:encodes"}, the program is incorrect. Therefore, all $k$ locations must be updated, and $k$ is the minimum. ◻
:::

## Independence and Degrees of Freedom {#sec:dof}

Not all encoding locations are created equal. Some are *derived* from others.

::: definition
[]{#def:independent label="def:independent"} Locations $L_1, L_2$ are *independent* for fact $F$ iff they can diverge. Updating $L_1$ does not automatically update $L_2$, and vice versa.

Formally: $L_1$ and $L_2$ are independent iff there exists a sequence of edits that makes $L_1$ and $L_2$ encode different values for $F$.
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:derived label="def:derived"} Location $L_{\text{derived}}$ is *derived from* $L_{\text{source}}$ iff updating $L_{\text{source}}$ automatically updates $L_{\text{derived}}$. Derived locations are not independent of their sources.
:::

::: example
[]{#ex:independence label="ex:independence"} Consider two architectures for the type registry:

**Architecture A (independent locations):**

    # L1: Class definition
    class PNGLoader(ImageLoader): ...

    # L2: Manual registry (independent of L1)
    LOADERS = {"png": PNGLoader}

Here $L_1$ and $L_2$ are independent. A developer can change $L_1$ without updating $L_2$, causing inconsistency.

**Architecture B (derived location):**

    # L1: Class definition with registration
    class PNGLoader(ImageLoader):
        format = "png"

    # L2: Derived registry (computed from L1)
    LOADERS = {cls.format: cls for cls in ImageLoader.__subclasses__()}

Here $L_2$ is derived from $L_1$. Updating the class definition automatically updates the registry. They cannot diverge.

:::

DOF is the key metric. Modification complexity $M$ counts all encoding locations. DOF counts only the independent ones. If all but one encoding location is derived, DOF = 1 even though $M$ may be large.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:dof-inconsistency label="thm:dof-inconsistency"} $\text{DOF}(C, F) = k$ implies $k$ different values for $F$ can coexist in $C$ simultaneously. With $k > 1$, incoherent states are reachable.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Each independent location can hold a different value. By Definition [\[def:independent\]](#def:independent){reference-type="ref" reference="def:independent"}, no constraint forces agreement between independent locations. Therefore, $k$ independent locations can hold $k$ distinct values. This is an instance of Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"} applied to software. ◻

## The DOF Lattice {#sec:dof-lattice}

DOF values form a lattice with distinct epistemic meanings:

::: center
   **DOF**  **Epistemic Status**
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------
      0     Fact $F$ is not represented (no encoding)
      1     Coherence guaranteed (truth determinate)
   $k > 1$  Incoherence possible (truth indeterminate under divergence)
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:dof-optimal label="thm:dof-optimal"} For any fact $F$ that must be encoded, $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$ is the unique value guaranteeing coherence:

1.  DOF = 0: Fact is not represented

2.  DOF = 1: Coherence guaranteed (by Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"})

3.  DOF $>$ 1: Incoherence reachable (by Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"})
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* This is a direct instantiation of Corollary [\[cor:coherence-forces-ssot\]](#cor:coherence-forces-ssot){reference-type="ref" reference="cor:coherence-forces-ssot"} to software:

1.  DOF = 0 means no location encodes $F$. The fact is unrepresented.

2.  DOF = 1 means exactly one independent location. All other encodings are derived. Divergence is impossible. Coherence is guaranteed.

3.  DOF $>$ 1 means multiple independent locations. By Corollary [\[cor:dof-risk\]](#cor:dof-risk){reference-type="ref" reference="cor:dof-risk"}, they can diverge. Incoherence is reachable.

Only DOF = 1 achieves coherent representation. This is epistemic necessity, not design preference. ◻
:::


# Single Source of Truth {#sec:ssot}

Having established the epistemic foundations (Section [\[sec:epistemic\]](#sec:epistemic){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:epistemic"}), we now define SSOT as the instantiation of coherence to software and prove its necessity.

## SSOT as Epistemic Coherence {#sec:ssot-def}

SSOT is not a design guideline. It is the unique representation guaranteeing epistemic coherence for facts encoded in software.

::: definition
[]{#def:ssot label="def:ssot"} Codebase $C$ satisfies *SSOT* for fact $F$ iff: $$\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$$ Equivalently: exactly one independent encoding location exists for $F$.
:::

**Epistemic interpretation:**

-   DOF = 1 means exactly one independent encoding location

-   All other locations are derived (cannot diverge from source)

-   Incoherence is *impossible*, not merely unlikely

-   Truth is determinate: the single source IS the value of $F$

::: theorem
[]{#thm:ssot-determinate label="thm:ssot-determinate"} If $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$, then for all reachable states of $C$, the value of $F$ is determinate: all encodings agree.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"}, DOF = 1 guarantees coherence. Coherence means all encodings hold the same value. Therefore, the value of $F$ is uniquely determined by the single source. ◻
:::

Hunt & Thomas's "single, unambiguous, authoritative representation" [@hunt1999pragmatic] corresponds precisely to this epistemic structure:

-   **Single:** DOF = 1

-   **Unambiguous:** No incoherent states possible (Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"})

-   **Authoritative:** The source determines all derived values

::: theorem
[]{#thm:ssot-optimal label="thm:ssot-optimal"} If $C$ satisfies SSOT for $F$, then modification complexity is 1: updating the single source maintains coherence.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $C$ satisfy SSOT for $F$, meaning $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$. Let $L_s$ be the single independent encoding location. All other encodings $L_1, \ldots, L_k$ are derived from $L_s$.

When fact $F$ changes:

1.  The developer updates $L_s$ (1 edit)

2.  By Definition [\[def:derived\]](#def:derived){reference-type="ref" reference="def:derived"}, $L_1, \ldots, L_k$ are automatically updated

3.  Coherence is maintained: all locations agree on the new value

Coherence restoration requires 1 edit. ◻
:::

::: theorem
[]{#thm:ssot-unique label="thm:ssot-unique"} SSOT (DOF=1) is the **unique** coherent representation for structural facts. DOF = 0 fails to represent; DOF $> 1$ permits incoherence.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"}, DOF = 1 guarantees coherence. By Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"}, DOF $> 1$ permits incoherence.

This leaves only DOF = 1 as coherent representation. DOF = 0 means no independent location encodes $F$---the fact is not represented.

Therefore, DOF = 1 is uniquely coherent. This is epistemic necessity, not design choice. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:no-redundancy label="cor:no-redundancy"} Multiple independent sources encoding the same fact permit incoherent states. DOF $> 1 \Rightarrow$ incoherence reachable.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Direct application of Theorem [\[thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence\]](#thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-gt-one-incoherence"}. With DOF $> 1$, independent locations can be modified separately, reaching states where they disagree. ◻
:::

## Coherence Restoration Complexity {#sec:ssot-vs-m}

When fact $F$ changes, how many edits are required to restore coherence?

-   With DOF = 1: 1 edit (the single source). All derived locations update automatically.

-   With DOF $= n > 1$: $n$ edits. Each independent location must be updated manually.

With SSOT, many locations may encode $F$, but coherence restoration requires only 1 edit. The derivation mechanism handles the rest.

::: example
[]{#ex:ssot-large-m label="ex:ssot-large-m"} Consider a codebase where 50 classes inherit from `BaseProcessor`:

    class BaseProcessor(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def process(self, data: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray: ...

    class Detector(BaseProcessor): ...
    class Segmenter(BaseProcessor): ...
    # ... 48 more subclasses

The fact $F$ = "All processors must have a `process` method" is encoded in 51 locations.

**Without SSOT (DOF = 51):** Changing the signature requires 51 edits. After each edit, coherence is partially restored. Only after all 51 edits is the system coherent.

**With SSOT (DOF = 1):** The ABC contract is the single source. Changing the ABC updates the specification; derived locations (type checker flags, runtime enforcement) update automatically. The *contract specification* has a single source.

Note: Implementations are separate facts. SSOT for the contract does not eliminate implementation edits---it ensures the specification is determinate.
:::

## Derivation: The Coherence Mechanism {#sec:derivation}

Derivation is the mechanism by which DOF is reduced without losing encodings. A derived location cannot diverge from its source, eliminating it as a source of incoherence.

::: definition
[]{#def:derivation label="def:derivation"} Location $L_{\text{derived}}$ is *derived from* $L_{\text{source}}$ for fact $F$ iff: $$\text{updated}(L_{\text{source}}) \rightarrow \text{automatically\_updated}(L_{\text{derived}})$$ No manual intervention is required. Coherence is maintained automatically.
:::

Derivation can occur at different times:

::: center
  **Derivation Time**   **Examples**
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  Compile time          C++ templates, Rust macros, code generation
  Definition time       Python metaclasses, `__init_subclass__`, class decorators
  Runtime               Lazy computation, memoization
:::

For *structural facts*, derivation must occur at *definition time*. Structural facts (class existence, method signatures) are fixed when the class is defined. Compile-time is too early (source not parsed). Runtime is too late (structure already fixed).

::: theorem
[]{#thm:derivation-excludes label="thm:derivation-excludes"} If $L_{\text{derived}}$ is derived from $L_{\text{source}}$, then $L_{\text{derived}}$ cannot diverge from $L_{\text{source}}$ and does not contribute to DOF.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By Definition [\[def:derivation\]](#def:derivation){reference-type="ref" reference="def:derivation"}, derived locations are automatically updated when the source changes. Let $L_d$ be derived from $L_s$. If $L_s$ encodes value $v$, then $L_d$ encodes $f(v)$ for some function $f$. When $L_s$ changes to $v'$, $L_d$ automatically changes to $f(v')$.

There is no reachable state where $L_s = v'$ and $L_d = f(v)$ with $v' \neq v$. Divergence is impossible. Therefore, $L_d$ does not contribute to DOF. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:metaprogramming label="cor:metaprogramming"} If all encodings of $F$ except one are derived from that one, then $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$ and coherence is guaranteed.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $L_s$ be the non-derived encoding. All other encodings $L_1, \ldots, L_k$ are derived from $L_s$. By Theorem [\[thm:derivation-excludes\]](#thm:derivation-excludes){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:derivation-excludes"}, none can diverge. Only $L_s$ is independent. Therefore, $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$, and by Theorem [\[thm:dof-one-coherence\]](#thm:dof-one-coherence){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-one-coherence"}, coherence is guaranteed. ◻
:::

## Coherence Patterns in Python {#sec:ssot-patterns}

Python provides several mechanisms for achieving DOF = 1 (coherent representation):

**Pattern 1: Subclass Registration via `__init_subclass__`**

    class Registry:
        _registry = {}

        def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):
            super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
            Registry._registry[cls.__name__] = cls

    class Handler(Registry):
        pass

    class PNGHandler(Handler):  # Automatically registered
        pass

The fact "`PNGHandler` is in the registry" is encoded in two locations:

1.  The class definition (source)

2.  The registry dictionary (derived via `__init_subclass__`)

DOF = 1 because the registry entry is derived. Incoherence is impossible: the registry cannot disagree with the class hierarchy.

**Pattern 2: Subclass Enumeration via `__subclasses__()`**

    class Processor(ABC):
        @classmethod
        def all_processors(cls):
            return cls.__subclasses__()

    class Detector(Processor): pass
    class Segmenter(Processor): pass

    # Usage: Processor.all_processors() -> [Detector, Segmenter]

The fact "which classes are processors" has DOF = 1: `__subclasses__()` is computed from the class definitions. No separate list can become stale.

**Pattern 3: ABC Contracts**

    class ImageLoader(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def load(self, path: str) -> np.ndarray: ...

        @abstractmethod
        def supported_extensions(self) -> List[str]: ...

The contract "loaders must implement `load` and `supported_extensions`" is encoded once in the ABC. The ABC is the single source; compliance is enforced. Truth about the contract is determinate.


# Language Requirements for SSOT {#sec:requirements}

We now derive the language features necessary and sufficient for achieving SSOT. This section answers: *What must a language provide for SSOT to be possible?*

The requirements are derived from SSOT's definition. The proofs establish necessity.

## The Foundational Axiom {#sec:axiom}

The derivation rests on one axiom, which follows from how programming languages work:

::: axiom
[]{#axiom:fixation label="axiom:fixation"} Structural facts are fixed at definition time. After a class/type is defined, its inheritance relationships, method signatures, and other structural properties cannot be retroactively changed.
:::

This is not controversial. In every mainstream language:

-   Once `class Foo extends Bar` is compiled/interpreted, `Foo`'s parent cannot become `Baz`

-   Once `def process(self, x: int)` is defined, the signature cannot retroactively become `(self, x: str)`

-   Once `trait Handler` is implemented for `PNGDecoder`, that relationship is permanent

Languages that allow runtime modification (Python's `__bases__`, Ruby's reopening) are modifying *future* behavior, not *past* structure. The fact that "`PNGHandler` was defined as a subclass of `Handler`" is fixed at the moment of definition.

**All subsequent theorems are logical consequences of this axiom.** Rejecting the axiom requires demonstrating a language where structural facts can be retroactively modified---which does not exist.

## The Timing Constraint {#sec:timing}

The key insight is that structural facts have a *timing constraint*. Unlike configuration values (which can be changed at any time), structural facts are fixed at specific moments:

::: definition
[]{#def:structural-timing label="def:structural-timing"} A structural fact $F$ (class existence, inheritance relationship, method signature) is *fixed* when its defining construct is executed. After that point, the structure cannot be retroactively modified.
:::

In Python, classes are defined when the `class` statement executes:

    class Detector(Processor):  # Structure fixed HERE
        def detect(self, img): ...

    # After this point, Detector's inheritance cannot be changed

In Java, classes are defined at compile time:

    public class Detector extends Processor {  // Structure fixed at COMPILE TIME
        public void detect(Image img) { ... }
    }

**Critical Distinction: Compile-Time vs. Definition-Time**

These terms are often confused. We define them precisely:

::: definition
[]{#def:compile-time label="def:compile-time"} *Compile-time* is when source code is translated to an executable form (bytecode, machine code). Compile-time occurs *before the program runs*.
:::

::: definition
[]{#def:definition-time label="def:definition-time"} *Definition-time* is when a class/type definition is *executed*. In Python, this is *at runtime* when the `class` statement runs. In Java, this is *at compile-time* when `javac` processes the file.
:::

The key insight: **Python's `class` statement is executable code.** When Python encounters:

    class Foo(Bar):
        x = 1

It *executes* code that:

1.  Creates a new namespace

2.  Executes the class body in that namespace

3.  Calls the metaclass to create the class object

4.  Calls `__init_subclass__` on parent classes

5.  Binds the name `Foo` to the new class

This is why Python has "definition-time hooks"---they execute when the definition runs.

Java's `class` declaration is *not* executable---it is a static declaration processed by the compiler. No user code can hook into this process.

The timing constraint has profound implications for derivation:

::: theorem
[]{#thm:timing-forces label="thm:timing-forces"} Derivation for structural facts must occur at or before the moment the structure is fixed.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $F$ be a structural fact. Let $t_{\text{fix}}$ be the moment $F$ is fixed. Any derivation $D$ that depends on $F$ must execute at some time $t_D$.

Case 1: $t_D < t_{\text{fix}}$. Then $D$ executes before $F$ is fixed. $D$ cannot derive from $F$ because $F$ does not yet exist.

Case 2: $t_D > t_{\text{fix}}$. Then $D$ executes after $F$ is fixed. $D$ can read $F$ but cannot modify structure derived from $F$---the structure is already fixed.

Case 3: $t_D = t_{\text{fix}}$. Then $D$ executes at the moment $F$ is fixed. $D$ can both read $F$ and modify derived structures before they are fixed.

Therefore, derivation for structural facts must occur at definition time ($t_D = t_{\text{fix}}$). ◻
:::

## Requirement 1: Definition-Time Hooks {#sec:hooks}

::: definition
[]{#def:hook label="def:hook"} A *definition-time hook* is a language construct that executes arbitrary code when a definition (class, function, module) is *created*, not when it is *used*.
:::

This concept has theoretical foundations in metaobject protocols [@kiczales1991art], where class initialization in CLOS allows arbitrary code execution at definition time. Python's implementation of this capability is derived from the same tradition.

**Python's definition-time hooks:**

::: center
  **Hook**                         **When it executes**
  -------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  `__init_subclass__`              When a subclass is defined
  Metaclass `__new__`/`__init__`   When a class using that metaclass is defined
  Class decorator                  Immediately after class body executes
  `__set_name__`                   When a descriptor is assigned to a class attribute
:::

**Example: `__init_subclass__` registration**

    class Registry:
        _handlers = {}

        def __init_subclass__(cls, format=None, **kwargs):
            super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
            if format:
                Registry._handlers[format] = cls

    class PNGHandler(Registry, format="png"):
        pass  # Automatically registered when class is defined

    class JPGHandler(Registry, format="jpg"):
        pass  # Automatically registered when class is defined

    # Registry._handlers == {"png": PNGHandler, "jpg": JPGHandler}

The registration happens at definition time, not at first use. When the `class PNGHandler` statement executes, `__init_subclass__` runs and adds the handler to the registry.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:hooks-necessary label="thm:hooks-necessary"} SSOT for structural facts requires definition-time hooks.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By Theorem [\[thm:timing-forces\]](#thm:timing-forces){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:timing-forces"}, derivation for structural facts must occur at definition time. Without definition-time hooks, no code can execute at that moment. Therefore, derivation is impossible. Without derivation, secondary encodings cannot be automatically updated. DOF $>$ 1 is unavoidable.

Contrapositive: If a language lacks definition-time hooks, SSOT for structural facts is impossible. ◻
:::

**Languages lacking definition-time hooks:**

-   **Java**: Annotations are metadata, not executable hooks. They are processed by external tools (annotation processors), not by the language at class definition.

-   **C++**: Templates expand at compile time but do not execute arbitrary code. SFINAE and `constexpr if` are not hooks---they select branches, not execute callbacks.

-   **Go**: No hook mechanism. Interfaces are implicit. No code runs at type definition.

-   **Rust**: Procedural macros run at compile time but are opaque at runtime. The macro expansion is not introspectable.

## Requirement 2: Introspectable Derivation {#sec:introspection}

Definition-time hooks enable derivation. But SSOT also requires *verification*---the ability to confirm that DOF = 1. This requires *computational reflection*---the ability of a program to reason about its own structure [@smith1984reflection].

::: definition
[]{#def:introspection label="def:introspection"} Derivation is *introspectable* iff the program can query:

1.  What structures were derived

2.  From which source each derived structure came

3.  What the current state of derived structures is
:::

**Python's introspection capabilities:**

::: center
  **Query**                            **Python Mechanism**
  ------------------------------------ -------------------------------------
  What subclasses exist?               `cls.__subclasses__()`
  What is the inheritance chain?       `cls.__mro__`
  What attributes does a class have?   `dir(cls)`, `vars(cls)`
  What type is this object?            `type(obj)`, `isinstance(obj, cls)`
  What methods are abstract?           `cls.__abstractmethods__`
:::

**Example: Verifying registration completeness**

    def verify_registration():
        """Verify all subclasses are registered."""
        all_subclasses = set(ImageLoader.__subclasses__())
        registered = set(LOADER_REGISTRY.values())

        unregistered = all_subclasses - registered
        if unregistered:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Unregistered loaders: {unregistered}")

This verification is only possible because Python provides `__subclasses__()`. In languages without this capability, the programmer cannot enumerate what subclasses exist.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:introspection-necessary label="thm:introspection-necessary"} Verifying that SSOT holds requires introspection.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Verification of SSOT requires confirming DOF = 1. This requires:

1.  Enumerating all locations encoding fact $F$

2.  Determining which are independent vs. derived

3.  Confirming exactly one is independent

Step (1) requires introspection: the program must query what structures exist and what they encode. Without introspection, the program cannot enumerate encodings. Verification is impossible.

Without verifiable SSOT, the programmer cannot confirm SSOT holds. They must trust that their code is correct without runtime confirmation. Bugs in derivation logic go undetected. ◻
:::

**Languages lacking introspection for derivation:**

-   **C++**: Cannot ask "what types instantiated template `Foo<T>`?"

-   **Rust**: Procedural macro expansion is opaque at runtime. Cannot query what was generated.

-   **TypeScript**: Types are erased at runtime. Cannot query type relationships.

-   **Go**: No type registry. Cannot enumerate types implementing an interface.

## Independence of Requirements {#sec:independence}

The two requirements---definition-time hooks and introspection---are independent. Neither implies the other.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:independence label="thm:independence"}

1.  A language can have definition-time hooks without introspection

2.  A language can have introspection without definition-time hooks
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* **(1) Hooks without introspection:** Rust procedural macros execute at compile time (a form of definition-time hook) but the generated code is opaque at runtime. The program cannot query what the macro generated.

**(2) Introspection without hooks:** Java provides `Class.getMethods()`, `Class.getInterfaces()`, etc. (introspection) but no code executes when a class is defined. Annotations are metadata, not executable hooks.

Therefore, the requirements are independent. ◻

## The Completeness Theorem {#sec:completeness}

::: theorem
[]{#thm:ssot-iff label="thm:ssot-iff"} A language $L$ enables complete SSOT for structural facts if and only if:

1.  $L$ provides definition-time hooks, AND

2.  $L$ provides introspectable derivation results
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* $(\Rightarrow)$ **Necessity:** Suppose $L$ enables complete SSOT for structural facts.

-   By Theorem [\[thm:introspection-necessary\]](#thm:introspection-necessary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:introspection-necessary"}, $L$ must provide introspection

$(\Leftarrow)$ **Sufficiency:** Suppose $L$ provides both definition-time hooks and introspection.

-   Definition-time hooks enable derivation at the right moment (when structure is fixed)

-   Introspection enables verification that all secondary encodings are derived

-   Therefore, SSOT is achievable: create one source, derive all others, verify completeness

The if-and-only-if follows. ◻

## The Logical Chain (Summary) {#sec:chain}

For clarity, we summarize the complete derivation from axiom to conclusion:

::: center
:::

**Every step is machine-checked in Lean 4.** The proofs compile with zero `sorry` placeholders. Rejecting this chain requires identifying a specific flaw in the axiom, the logic, or the Lean formalization.

## Concrete Impossibility Demonstration {#sec:impossibility}

We now demonstrate *exactly why* SSOT-incomplete languages cannot achieve SSOT for structural facts. This is not about "Java being worse"---it is about what Java *cannot express*.

**The Structural Fact:** "`PNGHandler` handles `.png` files."

This fact must be encoded in two places:

1.  The class definition (where the handler is defined)

2.  The registry/dispatcher (where format→handler mapping lives)

**Python achieves SSOT:**

    class ImageHandler:
        _registry = {}

        def __init_subclass__(cls, format=None, **kwargs):
            super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
            if format:
                ImageHandler._registry[format] = cls  # DERIVED

    class PNGHandler(ImageHandler, format="png"):  # SOURCE
        def load(self, path): ...

DOF = 1. The `format="png"` in the class definition is the *single source*. The registry entry is *derived* automatically by `__init_subclass__`. Adding a new handler requires changing exactly one location.

**Java cannot achieve SSOT:**

    // File 1: PNGHandler.java
    @Handler(format = "png")  // Annotation is METADATA, not executable
    public class PNGHandler implements ImageHandler {
        public BufferedImage load(String path) { ... }
    }

    // File 2: HandlerRegistry.java (SEPARATE SOURCE!)
    public class HandlerRegistry {
        static {
            register("png", PNGHandler.class);  // Must be maintained manually
            register("jpg", JPGHandler.class);
            // Forgot to add TIFFHandler? Runtime error.
        }
    }

DOF = 2. The `@Handler(format = "png")` annotation is *data*, not code. It does not execute when the class is defined. The registry must be maintained separately.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:generated-second label="thm:generated-second"} A generated source file constitutes a second encoding, not a derivation. Therefore, code generation does not achieve SSOT.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $F$ be a structural fact (e.g., "PNGHandler handles .png files").

Let $E_1$ be the annotation: `@Handler(format="png")` on `PNGHandler.java`.

Let $E_2$ be the generated file: `HandlerRegistry.java` containing `register("png", PNGHandler.class)`.

By Definition [\[def:dof\]](#def:dof){reference-type="ref" reference="def:dof"}, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are both encodings of $F$ iff modifying either can change the system's behavior regarding $F$.

Test: If we delete or modify `HandlerRegistry.java`, does the system's behavior change? **Yes**---the handler will not be registered.

Test: If we modify the annotation, does the system's behavior change? **Yes**---the generated file will have different content.

Therefore, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are independent encodings. DOF $= 2$. Formally: if an artifact $r$ is absent from the program's runtime equality relation (cannot be queried or mutated in-process), then $\text{encodes}(r,F)$ introduces an independent DOF.

The fact that $E_2$ was *generated from* $E_1$ does not make it a derivation in the SSOT sense, because:

1.  $E_2$ exists as a separate artifact that can be edited, deleted, or fail to generate

2.  $E_2$ must be separately compiled

3.  The generation process is external to the language and can be bypassed

Contrast with Python, where the registry entry exists only in memory, created by the class statement itself. There is no second file. DOF $= 1$. ◻
:::

**Why Rust proc macros don't help:**

::: theorem
[]{#thm:opaque-expansion label="thm:opaque-expansion"} If macro/template expansion is opaque at runtime, SSOT cannot be verified.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Verification of SSOT requires answering: "Is every encoding of $F$ derived from the single source?"

This requires enumerating all encodings. If expansion is opaque, the program cannot query what was generated.

In Rust, after `#[derive(Handler)]` expands, the program cannot ask "what did this macro generate?" The expansion is compiled into the binary but not introspectable.

Without introspection, the program cannot verify DOF $= 1$. SSOT may hold but cannot be confirmed. ◻
:::

**The Gap is Fundamental:**

The distinction is not "Python has nicer syntax." The distinction is:

-   Python: Class definition *executes code* that creates derived structures *in memory*

-   Java: Class definition *produces data* that external tools process into *separate files*

-   Rust: Macro expansion *is invisible at runtime*---verification impossible

This is a language design choice with permanent consequences. No amount of clever coding in Java can make the registry *derived from* the class definition, because Java provides no mechanism for code to execute at class definition time.


# Language Evaluation {#sec:evaluation}

We now evaluate mainstream programming languages against the SSOT requirements established in Section [\[sec:requirements\]](#sec:requirements){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:requirements"}. This evaluation is exhaustive: we check every mainstream language against formally-defined criteria.

## Evaluation Criteria {#sec:criteria}

We evaluate languages on four criteria, derived from the SSOT requirements:

::: center
  **Criterion**             **Abbrev**   **Test**
  ------------------------- ------------ -----------------------------------------------------
  Definition-time hooks     DEF          Can arbitrary code execute when a class is defined?
  Introspectable results    INTRO        Can the program query what was derived?
  Structural modification   STRUCT       Can hooks modify the structure being defined?
  Hierarchy queries         HIER         Can the program enumerate subclasses/implementers?
:::

**DEF** and **INTRO** are the two requirements from Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"}. **STRUCT** and **HIER** are refinements that distinguish partial from complete support.

**Scoring (Precise Definitions):**

-   = Full support: The feature is available, usable for SSOT, and does not require external tools

-   $\times$ = No support: The feature is absent or fundamentally cannot be used for SSOT

-   $\triangle$ = Partial/insufficient: Feature exists but fails a requirement (e.g., needs external tooling or lacks runtime reach)

**Methodology note (tooling exclusions):** We exclude capabilities that require external build tools or libraries (annotation processors, Lombok, `reflect-metadata`+`ts-transformer`, `ts-json-schema-generator`, etc.). Only language-native, runtime-verifiable features count toward DEF/INTRO/STRUCT/HIER.

**Note:** We use $\triangle$ sparingly for mainstream languages only when a built-in mechanism exists but fails SSOT (e.g., requires compile-time tooling or lacks runtime reach). For non-mainstream languages in Section [1.4](#sec:non-mainstream){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:non-mainstream"}, we note partial support where relevant since these languages are not our primary focus. For INTRO, we require *subclass enumeration*: the ability to answer "what classes inherit from X?" at runtime. Java's `getMethods()` does not satisfy this because it cannot enumerate subclasses without classpath scanning via external libraries.

## Mainstream Language Definition {#sec:mainstream-def}

::: definition
[]{#def:mainstream label="def:mainstream"} A language is *mainstream* iff it appears in the top 20 of at least two of the following indices consistently over 5+ years:

1.  TIOBE Index [@tiobe2024] (monthly language popularity)

2.  Stack Overflow Developer Survey (annual)

3.  GitHub Octoverse (annual repository statistics)

4.  RedMonk Programming Language Rankings (quarterly)
:::

This definition excludes niche languages (Haskell, Erlang, Clojure) while including all languages a typical software organization might consider. The 5-year consistency requirement excludes flash-in-the-pan languages.

:::

TypeScript earns $\triangle$ for DEF/INTRO because decorators (aligned with ES decorators since TypeScript 5.0, 2023) plus `reflect-metadata` can run at class decoration time and expose limited metadata, but (a) they require `experimentalDecorators` or specific tsconfig flags instead of being always-on language features, (b) they cannot enumerate implementers at runtime (no `__subclasses__()` equivalent), and (c) type information is erased at compile time. Consequently SSOT remains impossible without external tooling, so the overall verdict stays NO. **Note (as of 2026):** While ES decorators are now standard in JavaScript, they still lack subclass enumeration---the fundamental barrier to SSOT remains.

### Python: Full SSOT Support

Python provides all four capabilities:

**DEF (Definition-time hooks):**

-   `__init_subclass__`: Executes when a subclass is defined

-   Metaclasses: `__new__` and `__init__` execute at class creation

-   Class decorators: Execute immediately after class body

**INTRO (Introspection):**

-   `__subclasses__()`: Returns list of direct subclasses

-   `__mro__`: Returns method resolution order

-   `type()`, `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`: Type queries

-   `dir()`, `vars()`, `getattr()`: Attribute introspection

**STRUCT (Structural modification):**

-   Metaclasses can add/remove/modify class attributes

-   `__init_subclass__` can modify the subclass being defined

-   Decorators can return a different class entirely

**HIER (Hierarchy queries):**

-   `__subclasses__()`: Enumerate subclasses

-   `__bases__`: Query parent classes

-   `__mro__`: Full inheritance chain

### JavaScript: No SSOT Support

JavaScript lacks definition-time hooks:

**DEF:** $\times$. No code executes when a class is defined. The `class` syntax is declarative. Decorators (TC39 Stage 3, finalized 2024) exist but cannot access or enumerate subclasses at runtime.

**INTRO:** $\times$. `Object.getPrototypeOf()`, `instanceof` exist but *cannot enumerate subclasses*. No equivalent to `__subclasses__()`.

**STRUCT:** $\times$. Cannot modify class structure at definition time.

**HIER:** $\times$. Cannot enumerate subclasses. No equivalent to `__subclasses__()`.

### Java: No SSOT Support

Java's annotations are metadata, not executable hooks [@gosling2021java]:

**DEF:** $\times$. Annotations are processed by external tools (annotation processors), not by the JVM at class loading. The class is already fully defined when annotation processing occurs.

**INTRO:** $\times$. `Class.getMethods()`, `Class.getInterfaces()`, `Class.getSuperclass()` exist but *cannot enumerate subclasses*. The JVM does not track subclass relationships. External libraries (Reflections, ClassGraph) provide this via classpath scanning, but that is external tooling, not a language feature.

**STRUCT:** $\times$. Cannot modify class structure at runtime. Bytecode manipulation (ASM, ByteBuddy) is external tooling, not language-level support.

**HIER:** $\times$. Cannot enumerate subclasses without external libraries (Reflections, ClassGraph).

**Why annotation processors don't count:**

1.  They run at compile time, not definition time. The class being processed is already fixed

2.  They cannot modify the class being defined; they generate *new* classes

3.  Generated classes are separate compilation units, not derived facts within the source

4.  Results are not introspectable at runtime. You cannot query "was this method generated?"

**Why Lombok doesn't count:** Lombok approximates SSOT but violates it: the Lombok configuration becomes a second source of truth. Changes require updating both source and Lombok annotations. The tool can fail, be misconfigured, or be bypassed.

### C++: No SSOT Support

C++ templates are compile-time, not definition-time [@stroustrup2013cpp]:

**DEF:** $\times$. Templates expand at compile time but do not execute arbitrary code. `constexpr` functions are evaluated at compile time but cannot hook into class definition.

**INTRO:** $\times$. No runtime type introspection. RTTI (`typeid`, `dynamic_cast`) provides minimal information. Cannot enumerate template instantiations.

**STRUCT:** $\times$. Cannot modify class structure after definition.

**HIER:** $\times$. Cannot enumerate subclasses. No runtime class registry.

### Go: No SSOT Support

Go's design philosophy explicitly rejects metaprogramming [@gospec2024]:

**DEF:** $\times$. No hook mechanism. Types are defined declaratively. No code executes at type definition.

**INTRO:** $\times$. `reflect` package provides limited introspection but cannot enumerate types implementing an interface.

**STRUCT:** $\times$. Cannot modify type structure.

**HIER:** $\times$. Interfaces are implicit (structural typing). Cannot enumerate implementers.

### Rust: No SSOT Support

Rust's procedural macros are compile-time and opaque [@rustref2024]:

**DEF:** $\times$. Procedural macros execute at compile time, not definition time. The generated code is not introspectable at runtime.

**INTRO:** $\times$. No runtime type introspection. `std::any::TypeId` provides minimal information.

**STRUCT:** $\times$. Cannot modify type structure at runtime.

**HIER:** $\times$. Cannot enumerate trait implementers.

**Why procedural macros don't count:**

1.  They execute at compile time, not definition time. The generated code is baked into the binary

2.  `#[derive(Debug)]` generates code, but you cannot query "does this type derive Debug?" at runtime

3.  Verification requires source inspection or documentation, not runtime query

4.  No equivalent to Python's `__subclasses__()`. You cannot enumerate trait implementers

**Consequence:** Rust achieves *compile-time* SSOT but not *runtime* SSOT. For applications requiring runtime reflection (ORMs, serialization frameworks, dependency injection), Rust requires manual synchronization or external codegen tools.

*Proof.* By exhaustive evaluation. We checked all 10 mainstream languages against the four criteria. Only Python satisfies all four. The evaluation is complete. No mainstream language is omitted. ◻

## Non-Mainstream Languages {#sec:non-mainstream}

Three non-mainstream languages also satisfy SSOT requirements:

::: center
  **Language**          **DEF**   **INTRO**   **STRUCT**   **HIER**   **SSOT?**
  -------------------- --------- ----------- ------------ ---------- -----------
  Common Lisp (CLOS)                                                   **YES**
  Smalltalk                                                            **YES**
  Ruby                                         Partial                 Partial
:::

### Common Lisp (CLOS)

CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) provides the most powerful metaobject protocol:

**DEF:** . The MOP (Metaobject Protocol) allows arbitrary code execution at class definition via `:metaclass` and method combinations.

**INTRO:** . `class-direct-subclasses`, `class-precedence-list`, `class-slots` provide complete introspection.

**STRUCT:** . MOP allows complete structural modification.

**HIER:** . `class-direct-subclasses` enumerates subclasses.

CLOS is arguably more powerful than Python for metaprogramming. However, it is not mainstream by our definition.

### Smalltalk

Smalltalk pioneered many of these concepts:

**DEF:** . Classes are objects. Creating a class sends messages that can be intercepted.

**INTRO:** . `subclasses`, `allSubclasses`, `superclass` provide complete introspection.

**STRUCT:** . Classes can be modified at any time.

**HIER:** . `subclasses` enumerates subclasses.

### Ruby

Ruby provides hooks but with limitations [@flanagan2020ruby]:

**DEF:** . `inherited`, `included`, `extended` hooks execute at definition time.

**INTRO:** . `subclasses`, `ancestors`, `instance_methods` provide introspection.

**STRUCT:** Partial. Ruby's `inherited` hook receives the subclass *after* its body has been parsed, meaning the hook cannot intercept or transform the class definition as it is being constructed. Contrast with Python's `__init_subclass__`, which executes *during* class creation with access to keyword arguments passed in the class definition (e.g., `class Foo(Base, key=val)`). Ruby can add methods post-hoc via `define_method`, but cannot parameterize class creation or inject attributes before the class body executes.

**HIER:** . `subclasses` enumerates subclasses (added in Ruby 3.1).

Ruby is close to full SSOT support but the structural modification limitations (no parameterized class creation, no pre-body hook) prevent complete SSOT for use cases requiring definition-time configuration.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:three-lang label="thm:three-lang"} Exactly three languages in common use satisfy complete SSOT requirements: Python, Common Lisp (CLOS), and Smalltalk.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By exhaustive evaluation of mainstream and notable non-mainstream languages. Python, CLOS, and Smalltalk satisfy all four criteria. Ruby satisfies three of four (partial STRUCT). All other evaluated languages fail at least two criteria. ◻
:::

## Implications for Language Selection {#sec:implications}

The evaluation has practical implications:

**1. If SSOT for structural facts is required:**

-   Python is the only mainstream option

-   CLOS and Smalltalk are alternatives if mainstream status is not required

-   Ruby is a partial option with workarounds needed

**2. If using a non-SSOT language:**

-   External tooling (code generators, linters) can help

-   But tooling is not equivalent to language-level support

-   Tooling cannot be verified at runtime

-   Tooling adds build complexity

**3. For language designers:**

-   Definition-time hooks and introspection should be considered if DRY is a design goal

-   These features have costs (complexity, performance) that must be weighed

-   The absence of these features is a deliberate design choice with consequences


# Complexity Bounds {#sec:bounds}

We now prove the complexity bounds that make SSOT valuable. The key result: the gap between SSOT-complete and SSOT-incomplete architectures is *unbounded*---it grows without limit as codebases scale.

## Cost Model {#sec:cost-model}

::: definition
[]{#def:cost-model label="def:cost-model"} Let $\delta_F$ be a modification to fact $F$ in codebase $C$. The *effective modification complexity* $M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F)$ is the number of syntactically distinct edit operations a developer must perform manually. Formally: $$M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = |\{L \in \text{Locations}(C) : \text{requires\_manual\_edit}(L, \delta_F)\}|$$ where $\text{requires\_manual\_edit}(L, \delta_F)$ holds iff location $L$ must be updated by the developer (not by automatic derivation) to maintain coherence after $\delta_F$.
:::

**Unit of cost:** One edit = one syntactic modification to one location. We count locations, not keystrokes or characters. This abstracts over edit complexity to focus on the scaling behavior.

**What we measure:** Manual edits only. Derived locations that update automatically have zero cost. This distinguishes SSOT (where derivation handles propagation) from non-SSOT (where all updates are manual).

## Upper Bound: SSOT Achieves O(1) {#sec:upper-bound}

::: theorem
[]{#thm:upper-bound label="thm:upper-bound"} For a codebase satisfying SSOT for fact $F$: $$M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = O(1)$$ Effective modification complexity is constant regardless of codebase size.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $C$ satisfy SSOT for fact $F$. By Definition [\[def:ssot\]](#def:ssot){reference-type="ref" reference="def:ssot"}, $\text{DOF}(C, F) = 1$. Let $L_s$ be the single independent encoding location.

When $F$ changes:

1.  The developer updates $L_s$ (1 edit)

2.  All derived locations $L_1, \ldots, L_k$ are automatically updated by the derivation mechanism

3.  Total manual edits: 1

The number of derived locations $k$ may grow with codebase size, but the number of *manual* edits remains 1. Therefore, $M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = O(1)$. ◻
:::

**Note on "effective" vs. "total" complexity:** Total modification complexity $M(C, \delta_F)$ counts all locations that change. Effective modification complexity counts only manual edits. With SSOT, total complexity may be $O(n)$ (many derived locations change), but effective complexity is $O(1)$ (one manual edit).

## Lower Bound: Non-SSOT Requires $\Omega(n)$ {#sec:lower-bound}

::: theorem
[]{#thm:lower-bound label="thm:lower-bound"} For a codebase *not* satisfying SSOT for fact $F$, if $F$ is encoded at $n$ independent locations: $$M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = \Omega(n)$$
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $C$ not satisfy SSOT for $F$. By Definition [\[def:ssot\]](#def:ssot){reference-type="ref" reference="def:ssot"}, $\text{DOF}(C, F) > 1$. Let $\text{DOF}(C, F) = n$ where $n > 1$.

By Definition [\[def:independent\]](#def:independent){reference-type="ref" reference="def:independent"}, the $n$ encoding locations are independent---updating one does not automatically update the others. When $F$ changes:

1.  Each of the $n$ independent locations must be updated manually

2.  No automatic propagation exists between independent locations

3.  Total manual edits: $n$

Therefore, $M_{\text{effective}}(C, \delta_F) = \Omega(n)$. ◻
:::

## The Unbounded Gap {#sec:gap}

::: theorem
[]{#thm:unbounded-gap label="thm:unbounded-gap"} The ratio of modification complexity between SSOT-incomplete and SSOT-complete architectures grows without bound: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{M_{\text{incomplete}}(n)}{M_{\text{complete}}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{1} = \infty$$
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By Theorem [\[thm:upper-bound\]](#thm:upper-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:upper-bound"}, $M_{\text{complete}} = O(1)$. Specifically, $M_{\text{complete}} = 1$ for any codebase size.

By Theorem [\[thm:lower-bound\]](#thm:lower-bound){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:lower-bound"}, $M_{\text{incomplete}}(n) = \Omega(n)$ where $n$ is the number of independent encoding locations.

The ratio is: $$\frac{M_{\text{incomplete}}(n)}{M_{\text{complete}}} = \frac{n}{1} = n$$

As $n \to \infty$, the ratio $\to \infty$. The gap is unbounded. ◻
:::

::: corollary
[]{#cor:arbitrary-reduction label="cor:arbitrary-reduction"} For any constant $k$, there exists a codebase size $n$ such that SSOT provides at least $k\times$ reduction in modification complexity.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Choose $n = k$. Then $M_{\text{incomplete}}(n) = n = k$ and $M_{\text{complete}} = 1$. The reduction factor is $k/1 = k$. ◻
:::

## Practical Implications {#sec:practical-implications}

The unbounded gap has practical implications:

**1. SSOT matters more at scale.** For small codebases ($n = 3$), the difference between 3 edits and 1 edit is minor. For large codebases ($n = 50$), the difference between 50 edits and 1 edit is significant.

**2. The gap compounds over time.** Each modification to fact $F$ incurs the complexity cost. If $F$ changes $m$ times over the project lifetime, total cost is $O(mn)$ without SSOT vs. $O(m)$ with SSOT.

**3. The gap affects error rates.** Each manual edit is an opportunity for error. With $n$ edits, the probability of at least one error is $1 - (1-p)^n$ where $p$ is the per-edit error probability. As $n$ grows, this approaches 1.

:::: example
[]{#ex:error-rate label="ex:error-rate"} Assume a 1% error rate per edit ($p = 0.01$).

::: center
   **Edits ($n$)**   **P(at least one error)**   **Architecture**
  ----------------- --------------------------- ------------------
          1                    1.0%                    SSOT
         10                    9.6%                  Non-SSOT
         50                    39.5%                 Non-SSOT
         100                   63.4%                 Non-SSOT
:::

With 50 encoding locations, there is a 39.5% chance of introducing an error when modifying fact $F$. With SSOT, the chance is 1%.
::::

## Amortized Analysis {#sec:amortized}

The complexity bounds assume a single modification. Over the lifetime of a codebase, facts are modified many times.

::: theorem
[]{#thm:amortized label="thm:amortized"} Let fact $F$ be modified $m$ times over the project lifetime. Let $n$ be the number of encoding locations. Total modification cost is:

-   SSOT: $O(m)$

-   Non-SSOT: $O(mn)$
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Each modification costs $O(1)$ with SSOT and $O(n)$ without. Over $m$ modifications, total cost is $m \cdot O(1) = O(m)$ with SSOT and $m \cdot O(n) = O(mn)$ without. ◻
:::

For a fact modified 100 times with 50 encoding locations:

-   SSOT: 100 edits total

-   Non-SSOT: 5,000 edits total

The 50$\times$ reduction factor applies to every modification, compounding over the project lifetime.


# Practical Demonstration {#sec:empirical}

We demonstrate the theoretical results with concrete before/after examples from OpenHCS [@openhcs2025], a production bioimage analysis platform. These examples show how Python's definition-time hooks achieve SSOT for structural facts.

**Methodology:** This case study follows established guidelines for software engineering case studies [@runeson2009guidelines]. We use a single-case embedded design with multiple units of analysis (DOF measurements, code changes, maintenance metrics).

The value of these examples is *qualitative*: they show the pattern, not aggregate statistics. Each example demonstrates a specific SSOT mechanism. Readers can verify the pattern applies to their own codebases.

## SSOT Patterns {#sec:ssot-patterns-practical}

Three patterns recur in SSOT architectures:

1.  **Contract enforcement via ABC:** Replace scattered `hasattr()` checks with a single abstract base class. The ABC is the single source; `isinstance()` checks are derived.

2.  **Automatic registration via `__init_subclass__`:** Replace manual registry dictionaries with automatic registration at class definition time. The class definition is the single source; the registry entry is derived.

3.  **Automatic discovery via `__subclasses__()`:** Replace explicit import lists with runtime enumeration of subclasses. The inheritance relationship is the single source; the plugin list is derived.

## Detailed Examples {#sec:detailed-cases}

We present three examples showing before/after code for each pattern.

### Pattern 1: Contract Enforcement (PR #44 [@openhcsPR44])

This example is from a publicly verifiable pull request [@openhcsPR44]. The PR eliminated 47 scattered `hasattr()` checks by introducing ABC contracts, reducing DOF from 47 to 1.

**The Problem:** The codebase used duck typing to check for optional capabilities:

    # BEFORE: 47 scattered hasattr() checks (DOF = 47)

    # In pipeline.py
    if hasattr(processor, 'supports_gpu'):
        if processor.supports_gpu():
            use_gpu_path(processor)

    # In serializer.py
    if hasattr(obj, 'to_dict'):
        return obj.to_dict()

    # In validator.py
    if hasattr(config, 'validate'):
        config.validate()

    # ... 44 more similar checks across 12 files

Each `hasattr()` check is an independent encoding of the fact "this type has capability X." If a capability is renamed or removed, all 47 checks must be updated.

**The Solution:** Replace duck typing with ABC contracts:

    # AFTER: 1 ABC definition (DOF = 1)

    class GPUCapable(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def supports_gpu(self) -> bool: ...

    class Serializable(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def to_dict(self) -> dict: ...

    class Validatable(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def validate(self) -> None: ...

    # Usage: isinstance() checks are derived from ABC
    if isinstance(processor, GPUCapable):
        if processor.supports_gpu():
            use_gpu_path(processor)

The ABC is the single source. The `isinstance()` check is derived. It queries the ABC's `__subclasshook__` or MRO, not an independent encoding.

**DOF Analysis:**

-   Pre-refactoring: 47 independent `hasattr()` checks

-   Post-refactoring: 1 ABC definition per capability

-   Reduction: 47$\times$

### Pattern 2: Automatic Registration

This pattern applies whenever classes must be registered in a central location.

**The Problem:** Type converters were registered in a manual dictionary:

    # BEFORE: Manual registry (DOF = n, where n = number of converters)

    # In converters.py
    class NumpyConverter:
        def convert(self, data): ...

    class TorchConverter:
        def convert(self, data): ...

    # In registry.py (SEPARATE FILE - independent encoding)
    CONVERTERS = {
        'numpy': NumpyConverter,
        'torch': TorchConverter,
        # ... more entries that must be maintained manually
    }

Adding a new converter requires: (1) defining the class, (2) adding to the registry. Two independent edits, violating SSOT.

**The Solution:** Use `__init_subclass__` for automatic registration:

    # AFTER: Automatic registration (DOF = 1)

    class Converter(ABC):
        _registry = {}

        def __init_subclass__(cls, format=None, **kwargs):
            super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
            if format:
                Converter._registry[format] = cls

        @abstractmethod
        def convert(self, data): ...

    class NumpyConverter(Converter, format='numpy'):
        def convert(self, data): ...

    class TorchConverter(Converter, format='torch'):
        def convert(self, data): ...

    # Registry is automatically populated
    # Converter._registry == {'numpy': NumpyConverter, 'torch': TorchConverter}

**DOF Analysis:**

-   Pre-refactoring: $n$ manual registry entries (1 per converter)

-   Post-refactoring: 1 base class with `__init_subclass__`

-   The single source is the class definition; the registry entry is derived

### Pattern 3: Automatic Discovery

This pattern applies whenever all subclasses of a type must be enumerated.

**The Problem:** Plugins were discovered via explicit imports:

    # BEFORE: Explicit plugin list (DOF = n, where n = number of plugins)

    # In plugin_loader.py
    from plugins import (
        DetectorPlugin,
        SegmenterPlugin,
        FilterPlugin,
        # ... more imports that must be maintained
    )

    PLUGINS = [
        DetectorPlugin,
        SegmenterPlugin,
        FilterPlugin,
        # ... more entries that must match the imports
    ]

Adding a plugin requires: (1) creating the plugin file, (2) adding the import, (3) adding to the list. Three edits for one fact, violating SSOT.

**The Solution:** Use `__subclasses__()` for automatic discovery:

    # AFTER: Automatic discovery (DOF = 1)

    class Plugin(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def execute(self, context): ...

    # In plugin_loader.py
    def discover_plugins():
        return Plugin.__subclasses__()

    # Plugins just need to inherit from Plugin
    class DetectorPlugin(Plugin):
        def execute(self, context): ...

**DOF Analysis:**

-   Pre-refactoring: $n$ explicit entries (imports + list)

-   Post-refactoring: 1 base class definition

-   The single source is the inheritance relationship; the plugin list is derived

### Pattern 4: Introspection-Driven Code Generation

This pattern demonstrates why both SSOT requirements (definition-time hooks *and* introspection) are necessary. The code is from `openhcs/debug/pickle_to_python.py`, which converts serialized Python objects to runnable Python scripts.

**The Problem:** Given a runtime object (dataclass instance, enum value, function with arguments), generate valid Python code that reconstructs it. The generated code must include:

-   Import statements for all referenced types

-   Default values for function parameters

-   Field definitions for dataclasses

-   Module paths for enums

**Without SSOT:** Manual maintenance lists

    # Hypothetical non-introspectable language
    IMPORTS = {
        "sklearn.filters": ["gaussian", "sobel"],
        "numpy": ["array"],
        # Must manually update when types change
    }

    DEFAULT_VALUES = {
        "gaussian": {"sigma": 1.0, "mode": "reflect"},
        # Must manually update when signatures change
    }

Every type, every function parameter, every enum. Each requires a manual entry. When a function signature changes, both the function *and* the metadata list must be updated. DOF $>$ 1.

**With SSOT (Python):** Derive everything from introspection

    def collect_imports_from_data(data_obj):
        """Traverse structure, derive imports from metadata."""
        if isinstance(obj, Enum):
            # Enum definition is single source
            module = obj.__class__.__module__
            name = obj.__class__.__name__
            enum_imports[module].add(name)

        elif is_dataclass(obj):
            # Dataclass definition is single source
            function_imports[obj.__class__.__module__].add(
                obj.__class__.__name__)
            # Fields are derived via introspection
            for f in fields(obj):
                register_imports(getattr(obj, f.name))

    def generate_dataclass_repr(instance):
        """Generate constructor call from field metadata."""
        for field in dataclasses.fields(instance):
            current_value = getattr(instance, field.name)
            # Field name, type, default all come from definition
            lines.append(f"{field.name}={repr(current_value)}")

**The Key Insight:** The class definition at definition-time establishes facts:

-   `@dataclass` decorator $\to$ `dataclasses.fields()` returns field metadata

-   `Enum` definition $\to$ `__module__`, `__name__` attributes exist

-   Function signature $\to$ `inspect.signature()` returns parameter defaults

Each manual metadata entry is replaced by an introspection query. The definition is the single source; the generated code is derived.

**Why This Requires Both SSOT Properties:**

1.  **Definition-time hooks:** The `@dataclass` decorator executes at class definition time, storing field metadata that didn't exist before. Without this hook, `fields()` would have nothing to query.

2.  **Introspection:** The `fields()`, `__module__`, `inspect.signature()` APIs query the stored metadata. Without introspection, the metadata would exist but be inaccessible.

**Impossibility in Non-SSOT Languages:**

-   **Go:** No decorator hooks, no field introspection. Would require external code generation (separate tool maintaining parallel metadata).

-   **Rust:** Procedural macros can inspect at compile-time but metadata is erased at runtime. Cannot query field names from a runtime struct instance.

-   **Java:** Reflection provides introspection but no mechanism to store arbitrary metadata at definition-time without annotations (which themselves require manual specification).

The pattern is simple: traverse an object graph, query definition-time metadata via introspection, emit Python code. But this simplicity *depends* on both SSOT requirements. Remove either, and the pattern breaks.

## Summary {#sec:practical-summary}

These four patterns (contract enforcement, automatic registration, automatic discovery, and introspection-driven generation) demonstrate how Python's definition-time hooks achieve SSOT for structural facts:

-   **PR #44 is verifiable:** The 47 $\to$ 1 reduction can be confirmed by inspecting the public pull request.

-   **The patterns are general:** Each pattern applies whenever the corresponding structural relationship exists (capability checking, type registration, subclass enumeration, code generation from metadata).

-   **The mechanism is the same:** In all cases, the class definition becomes the single source, and secondary representations (registry entries, plugin lists, capability checks, generated code) become derived via Python's definition-time hooks and introspection.

The theoretical prediction (that SSOT requires definition-time hooks and introspection) is confirmed by these examples. The patterns shown here are instances of the general mechanism proved in Section [\[sec:requirements\]](#sec:requirements){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:requirements"}.


# Related Work {#sec:related}

This section surveys related work across four areas: the DRY principle, metaprogramming, software complexity metrics, and formal methods in software engineering.

## The DRY Principle {#sec:related-dry}

Hunt & Thomas [@hunt1999pragmatic] articulated DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as software engineering guidance in *The Pragmatic Programmer* (1999):

> "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

This principle has been widely adopted but never formalized. Our work provides:

1.  A formal definition of SSOT as DOF = 1

2.  Proof of what language features are necessary and sufficient

3.  Machine-checked verification of the core theorems

**Comparison:** Hunt & Thomas provide guidance; we provide a decision procedure. Their principle is aspirational; our formalization is testable.

## Metaprogramming and Reflection {#sec:related-meta}

**Metaobject Protocols:** Kiczales et al. [@kiczales1991art] established the theoretical foundations for metaobject protocols (MOPs) in *The Art of the Metaobject Protocol* (1991). MOPs allow programs to inspect and modify their own structure at runtime.

Our analysis explains *why* languages with MOPs (CLOS, Smalltalk, Python) are uniquely capable of achieving SSOT: MOPs provide both definition-time hooks and introspection, the two requirements we prove necessary.

**Reflection:** Smith [@smith1984reflection] introduced computational reflection in Lisp. Reflection enables programs to reason about themselves, which is essential for introspectable derivation.

**Python Metaclasses:** Van Rossum [@vanrossum2003unifying] unified types and classes in Python 2.2, enabling the metaclass system that powers Python's SSOT capabilities. The `__init_subclass__` hook [@pep487] (Python 3.6) simplified definition-time hooks, making SSOT patterns accessible without metaclass complexity.

## Software Complexity Metrics {#sec:related-complexity}

**Cyclomatic Complexity:** McCabe [@mccabe1976complexity] introduced cyclomatic complexity as a measure of program complexity based on control flow. Our DOF metric is orthogonal: it measures *modification* complexity, not *execution* complexity.

**Coupling and Cohesion:** Stevens et al. [@stevens1974structured] introduced coupling and cohesion as design quality metrics. High DOF indicates high coupling (many locations must change together) and low cohesion (related information is scattered).

**Code Duplication:** Fowler [@fowler1999refactoring] identified code duplication as a "code smell" requiring refactoring. Our DOF metric formalizes this: DOF $>$ 1 is the formal definition of duplication for a fact. Roy & Cordy [@roy2007survey] survey clone detection techniques; Juergens et al. [@juergens2009clones] empirically demonstrated that code clones lead to maintenance problems---our DOF metric provides a theoretical foundation for why this occurs.

## Information Hiding {#sec:related-hiding}

Parnas [@parnas1972criteria] established information hiding as a design principle: modules should hide design decisions likely to change. SSOT is compatible with information hiding:

-   The single source may be encapsulated within a module

-   Derivation exposes only what is intended (the derived interface)

-   Changes to the source propagate automatically without exposing internals

SSOT and information hiding are complementary: information hiding determines *what* to hide; SSOT determines *how* to avoid duplicating what is exposed.

## Formal Methods in Software Engineering {#sec:related-formal}

**Type Theory:** Pierce [@pierce2002types] formalized type systems with machine-checked proofs. Our work applies similar rigor to software engineering principles.

**Program Semantics:** Winskel [@winskel1993semantics] formalized programming language semantics. Our formalization of SSOT is in the same tradition: making informal concepts precise.

**Verified Software:** The CompCert project [@leroy2009compcert] demonstrated that production software can be formally verified. Our Lean 4 [@demoura2021lean4] proofs are in this tradition, though at a higher level of abstraction.

**Generative Programming:** Czarnecki & Eisenecker [@czarnecki2000generative] established generative programming as a paradigm for automatic program generation. Our SSOT patterns are a specific application: generating derived structures from single sources at definition time.

## Information-Theoretic Foundations {#sec:related-info-theory}

**Minimum Description Length:** Rissanen [@rissanen1978mdl] established the MDL principle: the best model minimizes total description length (model + data given model). Our DOF = 1 criterion is the software instantiation: the single source is the model; derived locations have zero marginal description length. Grünwald [@gruenwald2007mdl] provides comprehensive treatment of MDL optimality and uniqueness---our Theorem [\[thm:dof-optimal\]](#thm:dof-optimal){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:dof-optimal"} establishes the analogous uniqueness for software representations.

**Generative Complexity:** Heering [@heering2015generative; @heering2003software] formalized *generative complexity* as the Kolmogorov complexity of the shortest generator for a program family. SSOT architectures achieve minimal generative complexity by design: the single source *is* the shortest generator, and derived structures are its output. This connects our formalization to algorithmic information theory while remaining constructive---we exhibit generators, not just prove their existence.

**Comparison:** Prior work on generative complexity remained largely theoretical (Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable). Our contribution is the *constructive realization*: specific language features (DEF, INTRO) that achieve the theoretical minimum in practice. The DOF metric operationalizes generative complexity for software engineering.

## Language Comparison Studies {#sec:related-comparison}

**Programming Language Pragmatics:** Scott [@scott2015programming] surveys programming language features systematically. Our evaluation criteria (DEF, INTRO, STRUCT, HIER) could be added to such surveys.

**Empirical Studies:** Prechelt [@prechelt2000empirical] compared programming languages empirically. Our case studies follow a similar methodology but focus on a specific metric (DOF).

## Novelty of This Work {#sec:novelty}

To our knowledge, this is the first work to:

1.  Formally define SSOT as DOF = 1

2.  Prove necessary and sufficient language features for SSOT

3.  Provide machine-checked proofs of these results

4.  Exhaustively evaluate mainstream languages against formal criteria

5.  Measure DOF reduction in a production codebase

The insight that metaprogramming helps with DRY is not new. What is new is the *formalization* and *proof* that specific features are necessary, and the *machine-checked verification* of these proofs.


# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

## Methodology and Disclosure {#methodology-and-disclosure .unnumbered}

**Role of LLMs in this work.** This paper was developed through human-AI collaboration. The author provided the core intuitions (the DOF formalization, the DEF+INTRO conjecture, the language evaluation criteria), while large language models (Claude, GPT-4) served as implementation partners for drafting proofs, formalizing definitions, and generating LaTeX.

The Lean 4 proofs were iteratively developed: the author specified theorems to prove, the LLM proposed proof strategies, and the Lean compiler verified correctness. This is epistemically sound: a Lean proof that compiles is correct regardless of generation method. The proofs are *costly signals* (per the companion paper on credibility) whose validity is independent of their provenance.

**What the author contributed:** The DOF = 1 formalization of SSOT, the DEF+INTRO language requirements, the claim that Python uniquely satisfies these among mainstream languages, the OpenHCS case studies, and the complexity bounds.

**What LLMs contributed:** LaTeX drafting, Lean tactic exploration, prose refinement, and literature search assistance.

Transparency about this methodology reflects our belief that the contribution is the insight and the verified proof, not the typing labor.

::: center

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

We have provided the first formal foundations for the Single Source of Truth principle. The key contributions are:

**1. Formal Definition:** SSOT is defined as DOF = 1, where DOF (Degrees of Freedom) counts independent encoding locations for a fact. This definition is derived from the structure of the problem, not chosen arbitrarily.

**2. Uniqueness Theorem:** We prove that SSOT (DOF=1) is the **unique** minimal representation for structural facts (Theorem [\[thm:ssot-unique\]](#thm:ssot-unique){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-unique"}). Any system with DOF $> 1$ contains redundancy and is therefore non-minimal. This follows from the general uniqueness theorem for minimal complete representations (Paper 1).

**3. Language Requirements:** We prove that SSOT for structural facts requires (1) definition-time hooks AND (2) introspectable derivation. Both are necessary; both together are sufficient. This is an if-and-only-if theorem.

**4. Language Evaluation:** Among mainstream languages, only Python satisfies both requirements. CLOS and Smalltalk also satisfy them but are not mainstream. This is proved by exhaustive evaluation.

**5. Complexity Bounds:** SSOT achieves $O(1)$ modification complexity; non-SSOT requires $\Omega(n)$. The gap is unbounded: for any constant $k$, there exists a codebase size where SSOT provides at least $k\times$ reduction.

**6. Mathematical Necessity:** The uniqueness theorem (Theorem [\[thm:ssot-unique\]](#thm:ssot-unique){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-unique"}) establishes that DOF=1 is the unique minimal representation: $|\{r : \text{minimal}(r)\}| = 1$. This singleton solution space eliminates design freedom. Claiming "SSOT is a valid design choice among alternatives" while accepting uniqueness instantiates $P \land \neg P$: uniqueness entails $\neg\exists$ alternatives with equal minimality; preference presupposes $\exists$ such alternatives. Given minimality as a requirement, the mathematics forces DRY. This is not a guideline---it is the unique solution to the stated constraints.

**7. Practical Demonstration:** Concrete before/after examples from OpenHCS demonstrate the patterns in practice. PR #44 provides a verifiable example: migration from 47 `hasattr()` checks to ABC contracts, achieving DOF 47 $\to$ 1.

**Implications:**

1.  **For practitioners:** If SSOT for structural facts is required, Python (or CLOS/Smalltalk) is necessary. Other mainstream languages cannot achieve SSOT within the language.

2.  **For language designers:** Definition-time hooks and introspection should be considered if DRY is a design goal. Their absence is a deliberate choice with consequences.

3.  **For researchers:** Software engineering principles can be formalized and machine-checked. This paper demonstrates the methodology.

**Limitations:**

-   Results apply to *structural* facts. Configuration values and runtime state have different characteristics.

-   The complexity bounds are asymptotic. Small codebases may not benefit significantly.

-   Examples are from a single codebase. The patterns are general, but readers should verify applicability to their domains.

**Future Work:**

-   Extend the formalization to non-structural facts

-   Develop automated DOF measurement tools

-   Study the relationship between DOF and other software quality metrics

-   Investigate SSOT in multi-language systems

**Connection to Leverage Framework:**

SSOT achieves *infinite leverage* in the framework of the companion paper on leverage-driven architecture: $$L(\text{SSOT}) = \frac{|\text{Derivations}|}{1} \to \infty$$

A single source derives arbitrarily many facts. This is the theoretical maximum---no architecture can exceed infinite leverage. The leverage framework provides a unified view: this paper (SSOT) and the companion paper on typing discipline selection are both instances of leverage maximization. The metatheorem---"maximize leverage"---subsumes both results.

## Data Availability {#sec:data-availability}

**OpenHCS Codebase:** The OpenHCS platform (45K LoC Python) is available at <https://github.com/trissim/openhcs> [@openhcs2025]. The codebase demonstrates the SSOT patterns described in Section [\[sec:empirical\]](#sec:empirical){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:empirical"}.

**PR #44:** The migration from duck typing (`hasattr()`) to ABC contracts is documented in a publicly verifiable pull request [@openhcsPR44]: <https://github.com/trissim/openhcs/pull/44>. Readers can inspect the before/after diff to verify the DOF 47 $\to$ 1 reduction.

**Lean 4 Proofs:** The complete Lean 4 formalization (1,753 lines across 13 files, 0 `sorry` placeholders) [@openhcsLeanProofs] is included as supplementary material. Reviewers can verify the proofs by running `lake build` in the proof directory.


# Preemptive Rebuttals {#sec:rebuttals}

This appendix addresses anticipated objections, organized thematically. Each objection is stated in its strongest form, then refuted.

## Objection: The Model Doesn't Capture Real Semantics

**Objection:** "You've formalized a toy model and proved properties about it. But the model doesn't capture real Python/Rust semantics. The proofs are valid but vacuously true about artificial constructs."

**Response:** The model is validated through *instantiation proofs* that bridge abstract theorems to concrete language semantics. This is the standard methodology for programming language formalization [@pierce2002types].

#### The Two-Layer Architecture.

Paper 1 establishes this methodology:

1.  **Abstract layer:** Define the (B, S) model for any language with explicit inheritance

2.  **Instantiation layer:** Prove that concrete language features map to the abstract model

3.  **Theorem transfer:** Abstract theorems apply to the instantiation

#### Python Instantiation Proofs.

The file `PythonInstantiation.lean` (250 LOC) proves:

    -- Python's type() factors into (B, S)
    theorem python_type_is_two_axis (pt : PythonType) :
        exists B S, pythonTypeAxes pt = (B, S)

    -- All observables factor through axes
    lemma observables_factor_through_axes {p q : PythonType}
        (h : sameAxes p q) (attr : AttrName) :
        metaclassOf p = metaclassOf q /\
        getattrHas p attr = getattrHas q attr

The second theorem is the key: if two types have identical `__bases__` and `__dict__`, they are observationally indistinguishable. This proves the model captures Python's observable behavior.

#### Semantic Correspondence.

The `LangPython.lean` file (235 LOC) directly transcribes Python's documented semantics for class creation:

    -- Class definition events (from Python datamodel docs)
    inductive ClassDefEvent where
      | metacall_start : PyId -> ClassDefEvent
      | new_called : PyId -> ClassDefEvent
      | namespace_populated : PyId -> ClassDefEvent
      | init_subclass_called : PyId -> PyId -> ClassDefEvent
      | subclasses_updated : PyId -> PyId -> ClassDefEvent
      | init_called : PyId -> ClassDefEvent
      | class_bound : PyId -> ClassDefEvent

The theorem `init_subclass_in_class_definition` is then *derived* from this semantics---not assumed. The model is a direct encoding of Python's specification.

#### Falsifiability.

The model makes testable predictions. To falsify it, produce Python code where:

-   Two types with identical `__bases__` and `__dict__` behave differently, or

-   A subclass exists that is not in `__subclasses__()`, or

-   `__init_subclass__` does not fire during class definition

The model is empirically vulnerable. No counterexample has been produced.

#### The Interpretation Gap.

Every formalization eventually requires interpretation to connect symbols to reality. The claim is not "this Lean code IS Python" but "this Lean code models Python's observable behavior with sufficient fidelity that theorems transfer." The instantiation proofs establish this transfer.

## Objection: The SSOT Definition is Too Narrow

**Objection:** "Your definition of SSOT as DOF = 1 is too restrictive. Real-world systems have acceptable levels of duplication."

**Response:** The definition is **derived**, not chosen. DOF = 1 is the unique optimal point:

::: center
          **DOF**         **Meaning**
  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
             0            Fact is not encoded (underspecification)
             1            Single source of truth (optimal)
   $>$`<!-- -->`{=html}1  Multiple sources can diverge (inconsistency risk)
:::

DOF = 2 means two locations can hold different values for the same fact. The *possibility* of inconsistency exists. The definition is mathematical: SSOT requires DOF = 1. Systems with DOF $>$ 1 may be pragmatically acceptable but do not satisfy SSOT.

## External Tools vs Language-Level SSOT

External tools (annotation processors, code generators, build systems) can approximate SSOT behavior. These differ from language-level SSOT in three dimensions:

1.  **External to language semantics:** Build tools can fail, be misconfigured, or be bypassed. They operate outside the language model.

2.  **No runtime verification:** The program cannot confirm that derivation occurred correctly. Python's `__subclasses__()` verifies registration completeness at runtime. External tools provide no runtime guarantee.

3.  **Configuration-dependent:** External tools require project-specific setup. Python's `__init_subclass__` works in any environment without configuration.

The analysis characterizes SSOT *within language semantics*, where DOF = 1 holds at runtime.

## Objection: The Requirements Are Circular

**Objection:** "You define 'structural fact' as 'fixed at definition time,' then prove you need definition-time hooks. The conclusion is embedded in the definition---this is circular."

**Response:** The definition does not assume definition-time hooks; it defines what structural facts *are*. The derivation has three distinct steps:

1.  **Definition:** A fact $F$ is *structural* iff it is encoded in the syntactic structure of type definitions (class existence, method signatures, inheritance relationships). This is a classification, not a requirement.

2.  **Observation:** Structural facts are fixed when types are defined. This follows from what "syntactic structure" means---you cannot change a class's bases after the `class` statement completes.

3.  **Theorem:** Coherent derivation of structural facts requires hooks that execute at definition time. This is the actual result---it follows from the observation, not from the definition.

The circularity objection mistakes a *consequence* for a *premise*. We do not define structural facts as "requiring definition-time hooks." We define them by their syntactic locus, observe when they become fixed, and derive the necessary language features.

To reject this, you would need to show either:

-   Structural facts are NOT fixed at definition time (provide a counterexample), or

-   Coherent derivation can occur without definition-time hooks (provide the mechanism)

Neither objection has been sustained.

## Derivation Order

The analysis proceeds from definition to language evaluation:

1.  Define SSOT mathematically (DOF = 1)

2.  Prove necessary language features (definition-time hooks + introspection)

3.  Evaluate languages against derived criteria

4.  Result: Python, CLOS, and Smalltalk satisfy both requirements

Three languages satisfy the criteria. Two (CLOS, Smalltalk) are not mainstream. This validates that the requirements characterize a genuine language capability class. The requirements are derived from SSOT's definition, independent of any particular language's feature set.

## Empirical Validation

The case studies demonstrate patterns, with publicly verifiable instances:

-   PR #44: 47 `hasattr()` checks → 1 ABC definition (verifiable via GitHub diff)

-   Three general patterns: contract enforcement, automatic registration, automatic discovery

-   Each pattern represents a mechanism, applicable to codebases exhibiting similar structure

The theoretical contribution is the formal proof. The examples demonstrate applicability.

## Asymptotic Analysis

The complexity bounds are derived from the mechanism:

-   SSOT: changing a fact requires 1 edit (the single source)

-   Non-SSOT: changing a fact requires $n$ edits (one per encoding location)

-   The ratio $n/1$ grows unbounded as $n$ increases

PR #44 demonstrates the mechanism at $n = 47$: 47 `hasattr()` checks → 1 ABC definition. The 47$\times$ reduction is observable via GitHub diff. The gap widens as codebases grow.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

SSOT involves trade-offs:

-   **Benefit:** Modification complexity $O(1)$ vs $\Omega(n)$

-   **Cost:** Metaprogramming complexity, potential performance overhead

The analysis characterizes what SSOT requires. The decision to use SSOT depends on codebase scale and change frequency.

## Machine-Checked Formalization

The proofs formalize definitions precisely. Machine-checked proofs provide:

1.  **Precision:** Lean requires every step to be explicit

2.  **Verification:** Computer-checked, eliminating human error

3.  **Reproducibility:** Anyone can run the proofs and verify results

The contribution is formalization itself: converting informal principles into machine-verifiable theorems. Simple proofs from precise definitions are the goal.

## Build Tool Analysis

External build tools shift the SSOT problem:

1.  **DOF $\geq$ 2:** Build tool configuration becomes a second source. Let $C$ be codebase, $T$ be tool. Then $\text{DOF}(C \cup T, F) \geq 2$ because both source and config encode $F$.

2.  **No runtime verification:** Generated code lacks derivation provenance. Cannot query "was this method generated or hand-written?"

3.  **Cache invalidation:** Build tools must track dependencies. Stale caches cause bugs absent from language-native derivation.

4.  **Build latency:** Every edit requires build step. Language-native SSOT (Python metaclasses) executes during `import`.

External tools reduce DOF from $n$ to $k$ where $k$ is the number of tool configurations. Since $k > 1$, SSOT (DOF = 1) is not satisfied.

Cross-language code generation (e.g., protobuf) requires external tools. The analysis characterizes single-language SSOT.

## Objection: Inconsistency Is Only in Comments

**Objection:** "The proofs don't formalize 'inconsistency'---it only appears in comments. The heavy lifting is done by the comments, not by the formal system."

**Response:** This critique was valid for earlier versions. We have since added `Ssot/Inconsistency.lean` (216 LOC, zero `sorry`), which formalizes inconsistency as a Lean `Prop`:

    structure ConfigSystem where
      num_locations : Nat
      value_at : LocationId -> Value

    def inconsistent (c : ConfigSystem) : Prop :=
      exists l1 l2, l1 < c.num_locations /\ l2 < c.num_locations /\
                    l1 != l2 /\ c.value_at l1 != c.value_at l2

The file proves:

1.  **DOF $>$ 1 implies inconsistency possible:** `dof_gt_one_implies_inconsistency_possible`---we constructively exhibit an inconsistent configuration for any $n > 1$.

2.  **Guaranteed consistency requires DOF $\leq$ 1:** `consistency_requires_dof_le_one`---contrapositive of the above.

3.  **DOF = 0 means the fact is not encoded:** `dof_zero_means_not_encoded`---no locations implies the system cannot represent the value.

4.  **Independence formalized:** `update_preserves_other_locations`---updating one location does not affect others, formalizing what "independent" means.

5.  **Oracle necessity:** `resolution_requires_external_choice`---when locations disagree, there exist valid oracles that give different resolutions. Therefore, resolving disagreement requires an external, arbitrary choice. The system itself provides no basis to prefer one value over another.

This addresses the critique directly: inconsistency is now a formal property that Lean knows about, not a comment. The interpretation "this models real configuration systems" still requires mapping to reality, but every formalization eventually bottoms out in interpretation. The contribution is making assumptions *explicit and attackable*, not eliminating interpretation entirely.

## Objection: What About the Type's Name?

**Objection:** "Your two-axis model (B, S) ignores the type's name. Isn't N (the name) a third independent axis?"

**Response:** No. N is not an independent axis---it is a slot on the type object, set at definition time and immutable thereafter. Technically, `__name__` is stored on the `PyTypeObject` struct (a C-level slot), not in `__dict__`. However, this does not make it independent:

1.  **N is fixed at definition time.** The name is set by the `class` statement and cannot be changed without creating a new type.

2.  **N does not affect behavior.** Two classes with identical `__bases__` (B) and `__dict__` (S) behave identically. The name is a label, not an axis of variation.

3.  **N is observable but not discriminating.** You can query `cls.__name__`, but no Python code changes behavior based on it (except for debugging/logging).

The Lean formalization (AbstractClassSystem.lean) captures this:

    -- N is just a label for a (B, S) pair
    -- N contributes no observables beyond B
    -- Theorem obs_eq_bs proves: (B, S) equality suffices; N adds nothing

The operational test: given two classes with identical `__bases__` (B) and identical `__dict__` (S), can any Python code distinguish them behaviorally? No. The name is metadata, not a degree of freedom for the type's semantics.

This is why the model is (B, S) and not (B, S, N). N is a fixed label assigned at definition, not an independent axis that can vary.

## Objection: Model Doesn't Mirror Compiler Internals

**Objection:** "Your Rust model (RuntimeItem, erasure) doesn't mirror rustc's actual HIR→MIR phases. You haven't modeled proc-macro hygiene, `#[link_section]` retention, or the actual expander traces."

**Response:** We model *observable behavior*, not compiler implementation. The claim is:

> At runtime, you cannot distinguish hand-written code from macro-generated code.

This is empirically testable. Challenge: produce Rust code that, at runtime, recovers whether a given struct was written by a human or expanded by a macro---without external metadata files, build logs, or source access.

The model's `RuntimeItem` having no source field is *observationally accurate*: real Rust binaries contain no such field. Whether rustc internally tracks provenance during compilation is irrelevant; what matters is that this information is not preserved in the final artifact.

If the model is wrong, show the Rust code that falsifies it. The burden is on the critic to produce the counterexample.

## Objection: Rust Proc Macros + Static Registries Achieve DOF = 1

**Objection:** "Rust can achieve DOF = 1 using proc macros and static registries. Example:

    #[derive(AutoRegister)]
    struct MyHandler;
    static HANDLERS: &[&dyn Handler] = &[&MyHandler, ...];

The macro generates the registry at compile time. There's no second DOF that can diverge."

**Response:** This conflates *enabling* a pattern with *enforcing* it. The critical distinction:

1.  **Proc macros are per-item isolated.** When `#[derive(AutoRegister)]` executes on `MyHandler`, it cannot see `OtherHandler`. Each macro invocation is independent---there is no shared state during compilation. Therefore, no single macro can generate a complete registry.

2.  **Registration is bypassable.** You can write:

        struct SneakyHandler;
        impl Handler for SneakyHandler { ... }  // No #[derive]---NOT in registry

    The impl exists; the registry entry does not. **DOF = 2**: the impl and the registry are independent locations that can disagree.

3.  **The `inventory` crate uses linker tricks, not language semantics.** It works by emitting items into special linker sections and collecting them at link time. This is:

    -   Platform-specific (different on Linux, macOS, Windows)

    -   Not enforced---you can `impl Trait` without `#[inventory::submit]`

    -   External to language semantics (depends on linker behavior)

Contrast Python:

    class SneakyHandler(Registry):  # __init_subclass__ fires AUTOMATICALLY
        pass  # Cannot create unregistered subclass---IMPOSSIBLE

In Python, the hook is *unforgeable*. The language semantics guarantee that creating a subclass triggers `__init_subclass__`. There is no syntax to bypass this. **DOF = 1** by construction.

The objection confuses "can create a registry" with "can guarantee all items are in the registry." Rust enables the former; Python enforces the latter.

## Objection: You Just Need Discipline

**Objection:** "Real teams maintain consistency through code review, documentation, and discipline. You don't need language features."

**Response:** Discipline *is* the human oracle. The theorem states:

> With DOF $> 1$, consistency requires an external oracle to resolve disagreements.

"Discipline" is exactly that oracle---human memory, review processes, documentation conventions. This is not a counterargument; it is the theorem restated in different words.

The question is whether the oracle is:

-   **Internal** (language-enforced, automatic, unforgeable), or

-   **External** (human-maintained, fallible, bypassable)

Language-level SSOT provides an internal oracle. Discipline provides an external one. Both satisfy consistency when they work. The difference is failure mode: language enforcement cannot be forgotten; human discipline can.

## Objection: The Proofs Are Trivial

**Objection:** "Most of your proofs are just `rfl` (reflexivity). That means they're trivial tautologies, not real theorems."

**Response:** When you model correctly, theorems become definitional. This is a feature, not a bug.

Consider: "The sum of two even numbers is even." In a well-designed formalization, this might be `rfl`---not because it's trivial, but because the definition of "even" was chosen to make the property structural.

That said, not all proofs are `rfl`. The `rust_lacks_introspection` theorem is 40 lines of actual reasoning:

1.  Assume a hypothetical introspection function exists

2.  Use `erasure_destroys_source` to show user-written and macro-expanded code produce identical `RuntimeItem`s

3.  Derive that the function would need to return two different sources for the same item

4.  Contradiction

The proof structure (assumption → lemma application → contradiction) is genuine mathematical reasoning, not tautology. The `rfl` proofs establish the scaffolding; the substantive proofs build on that scaffolding.

## Objection: Real Codebases Don't Need Formal DOF

**Objection:** "Nobody actually needs Lean-enforced DOF guarantees. Conventions work fine in practice."

**Response:** This is an interpretation gap, not a flaw in the proof. We prove:

> IF you encode a fact in multiple locations AND require guaranteed consistency, THEN you need either DOF = 1 or an external oracle.

Whether real codebases "need" guaranteed consistency is an engineering judgment outside the scope of formal verification. The same gap exists for:

-   **CAP theorem:** Proves partition tolerance forces trade-off. Whether your system needs strong consistency is judgment.

-   **Rice's theorem:** Proves semantic properties are undecidable. Whether you need decidable analysis is judgment.

-   **Halting problem:** Proves general termination is undecidable. Whether your programs need termination guarantees is judgment.

The theorem characterizes what is *logically required*. Application to specific codebases requires human interpretation. This is philosophy, not mathematics, and lies outside the proof's scope.


# Lean 4 Proof Listings {#sec:lean}

All theorems are machine-checked in Lean 4 (9,351 lines across 26 files, 0 `sorry` placeholders, 541 theorems/lemmas). Complete source available at: `proofs/`.

This appendix presents the actual Lean 4 source code from the repository. Every theorem compiles without `sorry`. The proofs can be verified by running `lake build` in the `proofs/` directory.

## Model Correspondence {#sec:model-correspondence}

**What the formalization models:** The Lean proofs operate at the level of *abstract language capabilities*, not concrete language semantics. We do not model Python's specific execution semantics or Java's bytecode. Instead, we model:

1.  **DOF as a natural number:** $\text{DOF}(C, F) \in \mathbb{N}$ counts independent encoding locations

2.  **Language capabilities as propositions:** `HasDefinitionHooks` and `HasIntrospection` are *propositions derived from operational semantics*, not boolean flags. For example, `Python.HasDefinitionHooks` is proved by showing `init_subclass_in_class_definition`, which derives from the modeled `execute_class_statement`.

3.  **Derivation as a relation:** $\text{derives}(L_s, L_d)$ holds when $L_d$'s value is determined by $L_s$

**Soundness argument:** The formalization is sound if:

-   The abstract predicates correspond to actual language features (verified by the evaluation in Section [\[sec:evaluation\]](#sec:evaluation){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:evaluation"})

-   The derivation relation correctly captures automatic propagation (verified by concrete examples in Section [\[sec:empirical\]](#sec:empirical){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:empirical"})

**What we do NOT model:** Performance characteristics, type safety properties, concurrency semantics, or any property orthogonal to SSOT. The model is intentionally narrow: it captures exactly what is needed to prove SSOT requirements, and nothing more.

## On the Nature of Foundational Proofs {#sec:foundational-nature}

Before presenting the proof listings, we address a potential misreading: a reader examining the Lean source code will notice that many proofs are remarkably short, sometimes a single tactic like `omega` or `exact h`. This brevity is not a sign of triviality. It is characteristic of *foundational* work, where the insight lies in the formalization, not the derivation.

**Definitional vs. derivational proofs.** Our core theorems establish *definitional* properties and impossibilities, not complex derivations. For example, Theorem [\[thm:hooks-necessary\]](#thm:hooks-necessary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:hooks-necessary"} (definition-time hooks are necessary for SSOT) is proved by showing that without hooks, updates to derived locations cannot be triggered at definition time. The proof is short because it follows directly from the definition of "definition-time." If no code executes when a type is defined, then no derivation can occur at that moment. This is not a complex chain of reasoning; it is an unfolding of what "definition-time" means.

**Precedent in foundational CS.** This pattern appears throughout foundational computer science:

-   **Turing's Halting Problem (1936):** The proof is a simple diagonal argument, perhaps 10 lines in modern notation. Yet it establishes a fundamental limit on computation that no future algorithm can overcome.

-   **Brewer's CAP Theorem (2000):** The impossibility proof is straightforward: if a partition occurs, a system cannot be both consistent and available. The insight is in the *formalization* of what consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance mean, not in the proof steps.

-   **Rice's Theorem (1953):** Most non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable. The proof follows from the Halting problem via reduction, a few lines. The profundity is in the *generality*, not the derivation.

**Why simplicity indicates strength.** A definitional requirement is *stronger* than an empirical observation. When we prove that definition-time hooks are necessary for SSOT (Theorem [\[thm:hooks-necessary\]](#thm:hooks-necessary){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:hooks-necessary"}), we are not saying "all languages we examined need hooks." We are saying something universal: *any* language achieving SSOT for structural facts must have hooks, because the logical structure of the problem forces this requirement. The proof is simple because the requirement is forced by the definitions. There is no wiggle room.

**Where the insight lies.** The semantic contribution of our formalization is:

1.  **Precision forcing.** Formalizing "degrees of freedom" and "independent locations" in Lean requires stating exactly what it means for two locations to be independent (Definition [\[def:independent\]](#def:independent){reference-type="ref" reference="def:independent"}). This precision eliminates ambiguity that plagues informal DRY discussions.

2.  **Completeness of requirements.** Theorem [\[thm:ssot-iff\]](#thm:ssot-iff){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:ssot-iff"} is an if-and-only-if theorem: hooks AND introspection are both necessary and sufficient. This is not "we found two helpful features." This is "these are the *only* two requirements." The formalization proves completeness.

3.  **Universal applicability.** The SSOT requirements apply to *any* language, not just those we evaluated. A future language designer can check their language against these requirements. If it lacks hooks or introspection, SSOT for structural facts is impossible. Not hard, not inconvenient, but *impossible*.

**What machine-checking guarantees.** The Lean compiler verifies that every proof step is valid, every definition is consistent, and no axioms are added beyond Lean's foundations. Zero `sorry` placeholders means zero unproven claims. The 8,916 lines across 25 files (519 theorems/lemmas) establish a verified chain from basic definitions (edit space, facts, encoding) through grounded operational semantics (AbstractClassSystem, AxisFramework, NominalResolution, SSOTGrounded) to the final theorems (SSOT requirements, complexity bounds, language evaluation). Reviewers need not trust our informal explanations. They can run `lake build` and verify the proofs themselves.

**Comparison to informal DRY guidance.** Hunt & Thomas's *Pragmatic Programmer* [@hunt1999pragmatic] introduced DRY as a principle 25 years ago, but without formalization. Prior work treats DRY as a guideline, not a mathematical property. Our contribution is making DRY *formal*: defining what it means (DOF = 1), deriving what it requires (hooks + introspection), and proving the claims machine-checkable. The proofs are simple because the formalization makes the structure clear.

This follows the tradition of metatheory: Liskov & Wing [@liskov1994behavioral] formalized behavioral subtyping, Cook et al. [@cook1989inheritance] formalized inheritance semantics, Reynolds [@reynolds1983types] formalized parametricity. In each case, the contribution was not complex proofs, but *precise formalization* that made previously-informal ideas mechanically verifiable. Simple proofs from precise definitions are the goal, not a limitation.

## Language Evaluation: Semantics-Grounded Proofs {#sec:lean-languages}

The language capability claims are *derived from formalized operational semantics*, not declared as boolean flags. This is the key innovation that forecloses the "trivial proofs" critique.

### The Proof Chain (Non-Triviality Argument)

Consider the claim "Python can achieve SSOT." In the formalization, this is not a tautology. It is the conclusion of a multi-step proof chain:

    theorem python_can_achieve_ssot :
        CanAchieveSSOT Python.HasDefinitionHooks Python.HasIntrospection := by
      exact hooks_and_introspection_enable_ssot
        Python.python_has_hooks
        Python.python_has_introspection

Where `python_has_hooks` is proved from operational semantics:

    -- From LangPython.lean: __init_subclass__ executes at definition time
    theorem python_has_hooks : HasDefinitionHooks := by
      intro rt name bases attrs methods parent h
      exact init_subclass_in_class_definition rt name bases attrs methods parent h

    -- Which derives from the modeled class statement execution:
    theorem init_subclass_in_class_definition (rt : PyRuntime) ... :
        ClassDefEvent.init_subclass_called parent name \in
        (execute_class_statement rt name bases attrs methods).2 := by
      rw [execute_produces_events]
      exact hook_event_in_all_events name bases parent h

The claim is grounded in `execute_class_statement`, which models Python's class definition semantics. To attack this proof, one must either:

1.  Show the model is incorrect (produce Python code where `__init_subclass__` does not execute at class definition), or

2.  Find a bug in Lean's type checker.

Both are empirically falsifiable, not matters of opinion.

### Rust: The Non-Trivial Impossibility Proof

The Rust impossibility proof is substantive (40+ lines), not a one-liner:

    def HasIntrospection : Prop :=
      exists query : RuntimeItem -> Option ItemSource,
        forall item macro_name, -- query can distinguish user-written from macro-expanded
          exists ru in (erase_to_runtime user_state).items, query ru = some .user_written /\
          exists rm in (erase_to_runtime macro_state).items, query rm = some (.macro_expanded ...)

    theorem rust_lacks_introspection : not HasIntrospection := by
      intro h
      rcases h with <query, hq>
      -- Key lemma: erasure produces identical RuntimeItems
      have h_eq : (erase_to_runtime user_state).items =
                  (erase_to_runtime macro_state).items :=
        erasure_destroys_source item macro_name
      -- Extract witnesses and derive contradiction
      -- ... (35 lines of actual proof)
      -- Same RuntimeItem cannot return two different sources
      cases h_src_eq  -- contradiction: .user_written /= .macro_expanded

This proof proceeds by:

1.  Assuming a hypothetical introspection function exists

2.  Using `erasure_destroys_source` to show user-written and macro-expanded code produce identical `RuntimeItem`s

3.  Deriving that any query would need to return two different sources for the same item

4.  Concluding with a contradiction

This is a genuine impossibility proof, not definitional unfolding.

## Inconsistency.lean: Formal Inconsistency Model (216 lines) {#sec:lean-inconsistency}

## SSOTGrounded.lean: Bridging SSOT to Operational Semantics (184 lines) {#sec:lean-grounded}

This file is the key innovation addressing the "trivial proofs" critique. It bridges the abstract SSOT definition ($\text{DOF} = 1$) to concrete operational semantics from AbstractClassSystem. The central insight: SSOT failures arise when the same fact has multiple independent encodings that can diverge.

    end SSOTGrounded

**Why this matters:** The `ssot_unique_complete_consistent` theorem proves that DOF = 1 is the *unique* configuration class that is both complete (fact is encoded) and guarantees consistency (no observer can see different values). This is not a tautology---it is a constructive proof that any DOF $\geq 2$ admits an inconsistent configuration.

The `same_shape_different_provenance` theorem connects to Paper 1's capability analysis: shape-based typing loses the Bases axis, so two types with identical shapes can have different provenance. This is precisely the information loss that causes SSOT violations when type identity facts have DOF $> 1$.

## AbstractClassSystem.lean: Operational Semantics (3,276 lines) {#sec:lean-abstract-class}

This file provides the grounded operational semantics that make the SSOT proofs non-trivial. It imports directly from Paper 1's formalization, ensuring consistency across the paper sequence. Key definitions include:

-   **Typ**: Types with namespace ($\Sigma$) and bases list, modeling both structural and nominal information.

-   **shapeEquivalent**: Two types are shape-equivalent iff they have the same namespace (structural view).

-   **Capability enumeration**: Identity, provenance, enumeration, conflict resolution, interface checking.

-   **Language instantiations**: Python, Java, Rust, TypeScript with their specific capability profiles.

The central result is the *capability gap theorem*: shape-based observers cannot distinguish types that differ only in their bases. This formally establishes that structural typing loses information, which is the root cause of SSOT violations for type identity facts.

## AxisFramework.lean: Axis-Parametric Theory (1,721 lines) {#sec:lean-axis}

This file establishes the mathematical foundations of axis-parametric type systems. Key results include:

-   **Domain-driven impossibility:** Given any domain $D$, `requiredAxesOf D` computes the axes $D$ needs. Missing any derived axis implies impossibility---not implementation difficulty, but information-theoretic impossibility.

-   **Fixed vs. parameterized asymmetry:** Fixed-axis systems guarantee failure for some domains; parameterized systems guarantee success for all domains.

-   **Capability lattice:** Formal ordering of type systems by capability inclusion with Python at the top (full capabilities) and duck typing at the bottom.

## NominalResolution.lean: Resolution Algorithm (609 lines) {#sec:lean-nominal}

Machine-checked proofs for the dual-axis resolution algorithm:

-   **Resolution completeness** (Theorem 7.1): The algorithm finds a value if one exists.

-   **Provenance preservation** (Theorem 7.2): Uniqueness and correctness of provenance tracking.

-   **Normalization idempotence** (Invariant 4): Repeated normalization is identity.

## ContextFormalization.lean: Greenfield/Retrofit (215 lines) {#sec:lean-context}

Proves that the greenfield/retrofit classification is decidable and that provenance requirements are detectable from system queries. This eliminates potential circularity concerns by deriving requirements from observable behavior.

## DisciplineMigration.lean: Discipline vs Migration (142 lines) {#sec:lean-discipline}

Formalizes the distinction between discipline optimality (abstract capability comparison, universal) and migration optimality (practical cost-benefit, context-dependent). This clarifies that capability dominance is separate from migration cost analysis.

:::

**All 541 theorems/lemmas compile without `sorry` placeholders.** The proofs can be verified by running `lake build` in the `proofs/` directory. Every theorem in the paper corresponds to a machine-checked proof.

**Grounding note:** The formalization includes five major proof files from Paper 1 (AbstractClassSystem, AxisFramework, NominalResolution, ContextFormalization, DisciplineMigration) that provide the grounded operational semantics. This ensures that SSOT claims are not "trivially true by definition" but rather derive from a substantial formal model of type system capabilities.

Key grounded results:

1.  **Capability gap theorem** (AbstractClassSystem): Shape-based observers cannot distinguish types with different bases.

2.  **Axis impossibility theorems** (AxisFramework): Missing axes guarantee incompleteness for some domains.

3.  **Resolution completeness** (NominalResolution): Dual-axis resolution is complete and provenance-preserving.

4.  **Consistency is non-trivial:** DOF $\geq 2$ admits inconsistent configurations (constructive witness in Inconsistency.lean).

5.  **SSOT is uniquely optimal:** No other DOF value is both complete and guaranteed-consistent.

6.  **Language claims derive from semantics:** `python_can_achieve_ssot` chains through `python_has_hooks` to `init_subclass_in_class_definition` to `execute_class_statement`---not boolean flags.

7.  **Rust impossibility is substantive:** `rust_lacks_introspection` is a 40-line proof by contradiction, not definitional unfolding.

These grounded proofs connect the abstract DOF formalization to concrete operational semantics, ensuring the SSOT theorems have substantial content that cannot be dismissed as definitional tautologies.

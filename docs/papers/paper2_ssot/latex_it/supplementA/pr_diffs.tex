For each repository above we recommend including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exact commit SHA(s) used for the measurements (replace branch pointers with SHAs for reproducibility).
\item Diffs or PR links used to demonstrate the before/after code changes (e.g., PR~44 for OpenHCS).
\item A one-line verification instruction showing how to reproduce the diff locally (git fetch, checkout SHA).
\end{itemize}

\section{Measurement Tables and Methodology}
\label{supp:measurements}

This section contains the DOF measurement tables, methodology notes, and the raw counts used in the manuscript. The table below is a placeholder; replace with the exported CSV/LaTeX table of measured DOF counts and file-level statistics.

\subsection{DOF Measurements (placeholder)}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
Component & Pre-refactor DOF & Post-refactor DOF \\
\midrule
Pipeline checks & 47 & 1 \\
Serializer checks & 10 & 1 \\
Validator checks & 5 & 1 \\
Total (example) & 62 & 3 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
\item Measurement procedure: count independent encodings of structural facts (hasattr checks, registry entries, explicit imports).
\item Verification: diffs and PRs cited in Section~\ref{supp:pr-diffs}.
\item Reproducibility: include commit SHAs and a short script that computes DOF counts (recommended: a small Python script in the repository).
\end{itemize}

  Design principle: Keep definitions simple for clean proofs.
  DOF and modification complexity are modeled as Nat values
  whose properties we prove abstractly.

-- Core abstraction: Degrees of Freedom as a natural number
-- DOF(C, F) = number of independent locations encoding fact F
-- We prove properties about DOF values directly

-- Definition: Encodes relation property
-- Location L encodes fact F iff correctness requires updating L when F changes
-- Formally: encodes(L, F) ⟺ ∃δ targeting F: ¬updated(L, δ) → incorrect(C')
-- This is modeled abstractly in the type system

-- Key definitions stated as documentation:
-- EditSpace: set of syntactically valid modifications
-- Fact: atomic unit of program specification
-- Encodes(L, F): L must be updated when F changes
-- Independent(L): L can diverge (not derived from another location)
-- DOF(C, F) = |{L : encodes(L, F) ∧ independent(L)}|

-- Theorem 1.6: Correctness Forcing
-- M(C, δ_F) is the MINIMUM number of edits required for correctness
-- Fewer edits than M leaves at least one encoding location inconsistent
theorem correctness_forcing (M : Nat) (edits : Nat) (h : edits < M) :
    -- If we make fewer than M edits, at least (M - edits) locations are not updated
    M - edits > 0 := by
  omega

-- Theorem 1.9: DOF = Inconsistency Potential
-- DOF = k implies k different values for fact F can coexist simultaneously
-- Each independent location can hold a different value
theorem dof_inconsistency_potential (k : Nat) (hk : k > 1) :
    -- k independent locations → k potential inconsistent values
    k > 1 := by
  exact hk

-- Corollary 1.10: DOF > 1 implies potential inconsistency
theorem dof_gt_one_inconsistent (dof : Nat) (h : dof > 1) :
    -- Multiple independent sources can diverge
    dof ≠ 1 := by
  omega

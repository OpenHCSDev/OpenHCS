  SSOTGrounded: Connecting SSOT to Operational Semantics

  This file bridges the abstract SSOT definition (DOF = 1) to the
  concrete operational semantics from AbstractClassSystem.

  The key insight: SSOT failures arise when the same fact has multiple
  independent encodings that can diverge. This is formalized via:

  1. AbstractClassSystem proves: shape-based observers cannot distinguish
     types with same namespace but different bases (capability gap)

  2. This file proves: if a derived fact has DOF > 1, there exist
     observers that can see inconsistent values (operational inconsistency)

  Together: The capability gap from Paper 1 explains WHY DOF > 1 is bad.

  PART 1: Connecting DOF to Observable Consistency

  A configuration with DOF > 1 means the same fact is encoded in multiple
  places. If these places can be modified independently, observers can
  see inconsistent values.
-/

/-- A fact encoding location in a configuration -/
structure EncodingLocation where
  id : Nat
  value : Nat
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- A configuration with potentially multiple encodings of the same fact -/
structure MultiEncodingConfig where
  locations : List EncodingLocation
  -- DOF = number of independent encoding locations
  dof : Nat := locations.length

/-- All encodings agree on the value -/
def consistent (cfg : MultiEncodingConfig) : Prop :=
  ∀ l1 l2, l1 ∈ cfg.locations → l2 ∈ cfg.locations → l1.value = l2.value

/-- At least two encodings disagree -/
def inconsistent (cfg : MultiEncodingConfig) : Prop :=
  ∃ l1 l2, l1 ∈ cfg.locations ∧ l2 ∈ cfg.locations ∧ l1.value ≠ l2.value

/-- DOF = 1 implies consistency (SSOT = no inconsistency possible) -/
theorem dof_one_implies_consistent (cfg : MultiEncodingConfig)
    (h_nonempty : cfg.locations.length = 1) :
    consistent cfg := by
  intro l1 l2 h1 h2
  -- With only one location, l1 = l2
  cases hl : cfg.locations with
  | nil =>
    rw [hl] at h1

  | cons x xs =>
    rw [hl] at h_nonempty

  PART 2: Connecting to Type System Capabilities

  AbstractClassSystem proves that shape-based typing loses information
  (the Bases axis). This information loss is a form of DOF reduction
  that can cause inconsistency.
-/

/-- Type identity as an encoding location for provenance facts -/
def typeIdentityEncoding (T : Typ) : EncodingLocation :=
  ⟨0, T.bs.length⟩  -- Using bases length as a simple numeric encoding

/-- Two types with same shape but different bases encode provenance differently -/
theorem same_shape_different_provenance :
    ∃ T1 T2 : Typ,
      shapeEquivalent T1 T2 ∧
      typeIdentityEncoding T1 ≠ typeIdentityEncoding T2 := by
  -- Witness from AbstractClassSystem
  let parent : Typ := ⟨∅, []⟩
  let child : Typ := ⟨∅, [parent]⟩
  use child, parent
  constructor
  · -- Same shape (both have empty namespace)
    rfl
  · -- Different provenance encoding (different bases length)
    simp [typeIdentityEncoding, child, parent]

  PART 3: The Main Bridge Theorem

  SSOT is necessary because:
  1. DOF > 1 permits inconsistency (dof_gt_one_permits_inconsistency)
  2. DOF = 0 means fact not encoded (unusable)
  3. DOF = 1 is the unique consistent, complete encoding

  Combined with AbstractClassSystem:
  - Shape-based typing discards Bases axis (reduces observable DOF)
  - This causes capability gap (provenance, identity lost)
  - SSOT for type facts requires nominal typing (preserves full DOF)

/-- DOF ≥ 2 permits inconsistency (explicit witness) -/

/-- SSOT uniqueness: only DOF = 1 is both complete and guarantees consistency -/
theorem ssot_unique_complete_consistent :
    ∀ dof : Nat,
      dof ≠ 0 →  -- Complete: fact is encoded

  intro cfg h
  cases hl : cfg.locations with

/-- The trichotomy: every DOF is either incomplete, optimal, or permits inconsistency -/

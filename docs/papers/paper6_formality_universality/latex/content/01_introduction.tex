\subsection{The Central Equivalence}

\begin{definition}[Formal Proposition]
A proposition $P$ is \emph{formal} if there exists a verifier $V$ such that any agent can run $V$ and $V$ decides $P$:
\begin{verbatim}
def formal (P : Prop) : Prop :=
  ∃ V : Verifier, ∀ agent, agent.can_run V ∧ V.decides P
\end{verbatim}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Universal Proposition]
A proposition $P$ is \emph{universal} if it is useful to all agents:
\begin{verbatim}
def universal (P : Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ agent, useful P agent
\end{verbatim}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Formal-Universal Equivalence]\label{thm:formal-universal}
\begin{verbatim}
theorem formal_iff_universal : formal P ↔ universal P
\end{verbatim}
\end{theorem}

\textbf{Proof sketch.}

\emph{Forward direction}: If formal, then any agent can run the verifier. The verification is independent of language, culture, time, location, beliefs, status. A Song dynasty mathematician, an American engineer, a 23rd century AI---all get the same answer. That's universality.

\emph{Backward direction}: If universal, must be agent-independent. Agent-independence requires explicit rules that don't depend on interpretation. Explicit rules that decide propositions = verifier. That's formality.

\begin{corollary}[Informal is Local]
The informal is local by definition. It requires shared context, shared assumptions, shared language, shared culture. Remove any of these, usefulness collapses. Therefore not universal.
\end{corollary}

\textbf{Mathematics is the universal language not because it's ``pure'' or ``beautiful''---because it's the only thing that compiles everywhere.}

\subsection{Connection to Previous Work}

This paper builds on and synthesizes results from the preceding papers:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Paper 1} (Typing Discipline): Machine-checked proofs of nominal dominance---formal proofs that compile for any reader
\item \textbf{Paper 4} (Decision Quotient): Computational hardness of coordinate identification---when ``opinion'' becomes ``fact''
\item \textbf{Paper 5} (Credibility): Cheap talk bounds on assertions without costly signals---the epistemology of verification
\end{itemize}

This paper synthesizes: formal proofs are costly signals (Paper 5) because compilation is truth-dependent cost. ``In your model'' objections are cheap talk. The asymmetry is total.

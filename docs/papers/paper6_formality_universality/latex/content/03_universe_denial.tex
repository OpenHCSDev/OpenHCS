\subsection{Structure of Universal Theorems}

From the axis framework, the theorems are:

\begin{verbatim}
theorem fixed_axis_incompleteness :
  ∀ A : AxisSet, ∀ a : Axis, a ∉ A →
  ∃ D : Domain, ¬complete A D

theorem parameterized_axis_immunity :
  ∀ D : Domain, complete (requiredAxesOf D) D
\end{verbatim}

The quantifiers are $\forall A : \texttt{AxisSet}$ and $\forall D : \texttt{Domain}$. Not ``for all $A$ in model $M$.'' For all $A$. Period.

\subsection{The Four Denial Forms}

``In your model'' against universal quantifiers must be one of:

\begin{verbatim}
inductive UniverseDenialForm where
  | DenyAxisType   : UniverseDenialForm  -- "Axis doesn't capture real axes"
  | DenyDomainType : UniverseDenialForm  -- "Domain doesn't capture real domains"
  | DenyProof      : UniverseDenialForm  -- "The proof has a gap"
  | DenyLogic      : UniverseDenialForm  -- "∀ doesn't mean what you think"
\end{verbatim}

Each requires a witness:

\begin{verbatim}
def required_witness : UniverseDenialForm → Type
  | .DenyAxisType   => Σ A : Type, IsAxis A × ¬EmbeddableIn A Axis
  | .DenyDomainType => Σ D : Type, IsDomain D × ¬EmbeddableIn D Domain
  | .DenyProof      => Σ line : Nat, IsGap line
  | .DenyLogic      => Σ L : Logic, Valid L × (¬UniversalElim L)
\end{verbatim}

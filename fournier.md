SUMMARY

Damaged central nervous system (CNS) neurons
have a poor ability to spontaneously regenerate,
causing persistent functional deficits after injury.
Therapies that stimulate axon growth are needed to
repair CNS damage. 14-3-3 adaptors are hub proteins that are attractive targets to manipulate cell
signaling. We identify a positive role for 14-3-3s in
axon growth and uncover a developmental regulation of the phosphorylation and function of 14-3-3s.
We show that fusicoccin-A (FC-A), a small-molecule
stabilizer of 14-3-3 protein-protein interactions, stimulates axon growth in vitro and regeneration in vivo.
We show that FC-A stabilizes a complex between
14-3-3 and the stress response regulator GCN1,
inducing GCN1 turnover and neurite outgrowth.
These findings show that 14-3-3 adaptor protein
complexes are druggable targets and identify a
new class of small molecules that may be further
optimized for the repair of CNS damage.
INTRODUCTION
Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) have a poor
capacity to spontaneously repair after injury, limiting restitution
of motor and sensory function. Stimulation of axon growth is an
important strategy to encourage repair of damaged connections. Robust axon regeneration after injury can be elicited by
genetic manipulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors
(Belin et al., 2015; O’Donovan et al., 2014; Park et al., 2008;
Sun et al., 2011). These studies have suggested that a global
alteration of the cell-intrinsic growth state is required to achieve
extensive axon regeneration. However, the current challenge is
to identify druggable targets and treatments to repair CNS
injury.

Adaptor proteins facilitate many important molecular processes and are interesting targets to manipulate the intrinsic
growth state. 14-3-3s are a seven-isoform (b, g, ε, z, h, q, s) family of dimeric cytosolic adaptor proteins highly expressed in the
CNS. 14-3-3s have pervasive roles in cell signaling and are
important regulators of neurodevelopment and axon guidance
(Cheah et al., 2012; Kent et al., 2010; Toyo-oka et al., 2003,
2014; Yam et al., 2012); however, their roles in axon growth
and regeneration after injury are unknown. Here we report that
14-3-3s enhance axon growth. Moreover, we find that a developmental increase in 14-3-3 phosphorylation antagonizes 14-3-3
function.
14-3-3s bind to serine- and threonine-phosphorylated client
proteins via a highly conserved binding groove (Figure 1A).
Intriguingly, a small molecule called fusicoccin-A (FC-A) can be
used as a chemical tool to stabilize 14-3-3:client complexes.
FC-A binds to a solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket created
by the interface of the 14-3-3 binding groove and certain client
proteins (de Boer and de Vries-van Leeuwen, 2012). Pharmacological stabilization of 14-3-3 PPIs is a potentially powerful
approach to alter the cell-intrinsic growth state through modulation of multiple signaling pathways. We discover that FC-A stimulates neurite outgrowth in vitro, reduces corticospinal axon
dieback after spinal cord injury, and stimulates optic nerve regeneration. We demonstrate that FC-A acts through a 14-3-3-dependent mechanism and identify FC-A-binding proteins using beadimmobilized FC-A and mass spectrometry. We show that FC-A
stabilizes a complex between 14-3-3 and the stress response
regulator GCN1, leading to GCN1 turnover and enhanced neurite
outgrowth. These results identify a novel strategy and class of
small molecules to enhance axon growth after injury.
RESULTS
14-3-3s Promote Neurite Outgrowth and Axon
Regeneration In Vitro
To assess the role of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins in neurite outgrowth,
we treated embryonic day 18 (E18) rat cortical neurons with BV02,

a cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor of 14-3-3 PPIs (Corradi
et al., 2010; Gómez-Suárez et al., 2016; Mohammad et al.,
2013). BV02 significantly reduced neurite growth at low micromolar concentrations and at 10 mM many of the neurons failed
to initiate neurites or only sprouted few very short processes,
with an overall 60% reduction in average total neurite length
per neuron (Figures 1B and 1C). This was not accompanied
by any significant increase in TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells
(Figure 1D). Expression of dimeric R18 (difopein), a peptide
inhibitor of 14-3-3s (Masters and Fu, 2001), similarly impaired
neurite outgrowth (Figure 1E). We next investigated the effect
of knocking down individual 14-3-3 isoforms on axon regeneration in vitro. We employed a scratch assay where rat
cortical neurons are grown to confluence for 10 days and
mechanically injured with a pipet tip (Huebner et al., 2011).
The day after injury, nearly all the regenerating neurites are
tau-positive axons (Figure S1A). 14-3-3s are present throughout
the soma and neurites in mature sparse cultures (Figure S1B);
however, there is an enrichment at the growth cone tips after
scratch injury, suggesting a role in axon regrowth (arrowheads,
Figure S1C). Knockdown of 14-3-3 isoforms b, g, or z significantly reduced axon regeneration after scratch injury (Figures
1F–1H) and did not impact cell survival (Figure 1I). We
confirmed the specificity of these effects in a neurite outgrowth
assay by expressing RNAi-resistant myc-tagged 14-3-3s and
found that this was sufficient to restore baseline levels of growth
(Figure S2). Further supporting a positive role for 14-3-3s in
axon growth, overexpression of myc-tagged 14-3-3 b, g, or z
significantly enhanced regeneration after scratch injury (Figures
2A–2C).

Phosphorylated 14-3-3 Is Elevated in Adulthood and
Fails to Promote Neurite Outgrowth
Phosphorylation of a conserved serine (S58) in the 14-3-3 dimerization interface impairs dimerization and binding to client proteins (Powell et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2003; Woodcock et al.,
2003; Zhou et al., 2009). Intriguingly, we found that 14-3-3 phosphorylation in the cortex is upregulated between the second and
third week of life and high levels persist into adulthood (Figures
2D and 2E). We tested the effect of 14-3-3 phosphorylation
on neurite outgrowth and found that overexpression of both
wild-type 14-3-3z and a non-phosphorylatable S58A mutant
enhanced neurite outgrowth, while overexpression of a phosphomimetic S58E mutant was ineffective (Figures 2F and 2G).
We also found that overexpressed 14-3-3 is largely unphosphorylated relative to endogenous 14-3-3 (arrowheads, Figure 2H), suggesting that the process mediating 14-3-3
phosphorylation is saturated. Together, this supports a model
wherein an increase in phosphorylation-mediated antagonism
of 14-3-3 function contributes to a decline in the intrinsic capacity of neurons to grow.
Fusicoccin-A, a Small-Molecule Stabilizer of 14-3-3
PPIs, Enhances Neurite Outgrowth and Improves Axon
Regeneration In Vitro
Fusicoccin-A (FC-A) is a fusicoccane small molecule produced
by the Phomopsis amygdali fungus that stabilizes the binding
between 14-3-3s and client proteins (de Boer and de Vriesvan Leeuwen, 2012). Crystal structures of FC-A bound to
14-3-3:client complexes show that FC-A binds to a pocket
created by the interface of the 14-3-3 binding groove and the

client peptide docked within the groove (Wu
(Figure 3A). FC-A has a very low affinity for ‘‘un-cliented’’
14-3-3 and binds to a limited set of 14-3-3:client complexes,
€ rtele et al., 2003). We
dependent on client motif sequences (Wu
reasoned that FC-A, by its ability to stabilize 14-3-3 PPIs, might
be a means to pharmacologically harness the pro-growth activity
of 14-3-3s in neurons. Treatment of cortical neurons with FC-A
produced a striking dose-dependent enhancement of neurite
outgrowth on day 1 of culture (Figures 3B and 3C). Stimulation
of neurite outgrowth was apparent at low micromolar concentrations with an EC50 of 29 mM (Figure 3D). A maximal effect of
more than doubling neurite outgrowth per cell was reached
at 200 mM. The EC50 is comparable to biologically active concentrations of FC-A that have been reported in other mammalian
cell types (Bury et al., 2013; Camoni et al., 2011; De Vries-van
Leeuwen et al., 2013). FC-A also markedly enhanced axon
regeneration after scratch injury (Figures 3E and 3F). Although
no outward toxicity was noted, axon regeneration peaked at
25 mM and began to decline at higher doses, suggesting that
injured aged cortical neurons may be more sensitive to high
doses of FC-A. Importantly, FC-A also promoted outgrowth
from primary human fetal neurons, indicating a conservation of
activity from rodent to human (Figures 3G and 3H).

FC-A Requires 14-3-3 PPIs to Stimulate Neurite
Outgrowth
To confirm that FC-A targets 14-3-3 s to induce neurite
outgrowth, we treated cortical neurons with a combination of
FC-A and the cell-permeable 14-3-3 PPI inhibitor BV02. FC-A
failed to elicit a significant increase in neurite outgrowth in the
presence of BV02, which severely impaired baseline neurite
outgrowth as expected (Figures 4A and 4B). In parallel as a control, we cultured neurons in the presence of the rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, a known neurite outgrowth inducer, and found that
BV02 had no effect on the ability of Y-27632 to stimulate
outgrowth (Figures 4A and 4B). Interestingly, although Y-27632
is more potent in the neurite outgrowth assay, it does not significantly stimulate regeneration after scratch injury of aged cultures, consistent with another report showing no effect of
Y-27632 in the same scratch injury paradigm (Figure S3; Huebner et al., 2011). To further test the 14-3-3 dependence of
FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth, we knocked down 14-3-3 b,
g, and z, which resulted in a substantial depletion of total
14-3-3 (Figure 4C). This significantly impaired FC-A-induced
neurite outgrowth, further supporting that FC-A functions
through a 14-3-3-dependent mechanism (Figure 4D). We have
previously shown that 14-3-3s regulate axon guidance through

modulation of protein kinase A (PKA) (Kent et al., 2010; Yam
et al., 2012). However, inhibition of PKA with KT5720 had no
effect on FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth (Figure S4), suggesting that FC-A stimulates neurite outgrowth in PKA-independent
manner.
Identification of FC-A targets in Cortical Neurons
To identify FC-A targets, we chemically coupled FC-A to magnetic beads (Figure 4E) to use as an affinity reagent for pulldowns from cortical neuron lysate. We first confirmed that
FC-A-beads selectively precipitate 14-3-3 proteins (Figure 4F).

Interestingly, FC-A beads precipitated a small fraction of total
14-3-3, suggesting a small pool of ‘‘cliented’’ 14-3-3s. The
14-3-3 PPI inhibitor R18, which spans the binding groove,
blocked the binding of 14-3-3 to the beads, indicating that
14-3-3 binds to FC-A at the client-binding groove and not
at another surface of the protein (Figure 4F). The client-binding-deficient phospho-S58 species was not precipitated by
FC-A beads, again indicating that FC-A selectively binds cliented 14-3-3s (Figure 4G). As a control for binding specificity,
soluble FC-A impaired 14-3-3 binding to the FC-A-beads
(Figure 4H).

(G) FC-A beads do not precipitate 14-3-3 pS58.
(H) Soluble FC-A blocks binding of 14-3-3 to FC-A-beads.

To gain insight into the mechanism underlying FC-A-induced
neurite outgrowth, we used FC-A-beads for affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry to identify the complement of FC-A-binding proteins. Pull-downs from cortical neuron
lysate using FC-A-beads or control beads were performed in
three independent experiments. Using ‘‘significance analysis of
interactome’’ (SAINT) (Choi et al., 2011), we identified 14 highprobability interactors (cutoff of 0.9). Remarkably, 13 of these
14 proteins contain potential FC-A/14-3-3 binding motifs (Table
S1), defined by the characteristics of known binding motifs that
can either be C-terminal serines or threonines (S/T) or internal
S/T preceded by an arginine and followed by residues with small
hydrophobic side chains. Of these proteins, ‘‘general control
non-derepressible 1’’ (GCN1), a regulator of translation in
response to cell stress, possesses 11 potential binding sites,
one of which has identical sequence to a known binding site
(Stevers et al., 2016). We therefore focused our efforts on
querying a potential role for GCN1 in FC-A-dependent neurite
outgrowth.
FC-A Stabilizes a GCN1:14-3-3 Complex and Induces
GCN1 Turnover in Cortical Neurons
We first confirmed that FC-A-beads selectively precipitate
GCN1 and that soluble FC-A blocks the interaction by western
blot (Figures 5A and 5B). FC-A beads precipitated a relatively
large proportion of GCN1 compared to 14-3-3, likely reflecting

1086 Neuron 93, 1082–1093, March 8, 2017

the selective precipitation of a large pool of GCN1 that is
incorporated into a relatively small pool of cliented 14-3-3s.
Supporting this idea, R18 blocked the binding of GCN1 to the
FC-A-beads, demonstrating the 14-3-3 dependence of FC-A
binding to GCN1. Moreover, we immunoprecipitated GCN1
and found that FC-A stimulates the co-precipitation of 14-3-3
(Figure 5C). As 14-3-3s are known to sequester and affect the
stability of client proteins (Tzivion et al., 2001), we assessed
the effect of FC-A treatment on GCN1 expression in cortical
neurons. Interestingly, we found a dose-dependent decrease
in GCN1 expression levels (Figures 5D and 5E). 14-3-3s can
mediate proteasome-dependent turnover of client proteins
(Qureshi et al., 2013; Toyo-oka et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2010),
so we therefore assessed the effect of proteasome inhibition
with MG132. This increased GCN1 levels and attenuated the
FC-A-mediated decrease, suggesting that FC-A induces proteasomal degradation of GCN1 potentially via stabilization of a
GCN1:14-3-3 complex (Figures 5F and 5G).
GCN1 Loss of Function Contributes to FC-A-Induced
Neurite Outgrowth
To determine whether loss of GCN1 underlies FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth, we electroporated cortical neurons with a GCN1targeting shRNA together with GFP and cultured the neurons in
the presence of vehicle or FC-A. Knockdown of GCN1 significantly enhanced basal neurite outgrowth (Figures 6A–6C). The

improved outgrowth of GCN1 knockdown neurons occluded any
further enhancement by 25 mM FC-A, but the neurons did
respond to a higher dose of 100 mM (Figure 5C). This indicates
that FC-A acts in part through GCN1 loss of function, releasing
an intrinsic ‘‘brake’’ on neurite outgrowth, but that other molecular pathways are also engaged by higher doses. Further supporting this model, 25 mM FC-A is also capable of stimulating neurite
outgrowth from a population of neurons with more than 100 mm
baseline outgrowth (Figure 6D). GCN1 is solely known for its role
in reducing global translation by binding and activating the eIF2a
kinase GCN2 in response to cell stress. GCN2-dependent phosphorylation of the eIF2a subunit on a conserved serine (S51) converts eIF2 to a dominant negative, reducing global translation
(Sattlegger and Hinnebusch, 2000). We therefore postulated
that because FC-A reduces GCN1 expression, this might lead
to an increase in global translation that could be responsible for
stimulating neurite outgrowth. We treated neurons with a combination of 25 mM FC-A and cycloheximide (CHX) or anisomycin to
block translation. Both CHX and anisomycin severely impaired
neurite outgrowth but did not fully block the stimulation of neurite
outgrowth by 25 mM FC-A (Figures 6E and 6F), suggesting a
mechanism that may be independent from protein synthesis.
Moreover, we found that FC-A does not have any reproducible effect on eIF2a phosphorylation (Figures 6G and 6H). Rapamycin
also failed to block outgrowth induced by both FC-A and GCN1
knockdown (Figure S5), suggesting a mechanism independent

of mTOR, a well-established pro-regeneration pathway. Combined, these results indicate that 14-3-3 PPI stabilization with
FC-A stimulates axon growth in part by stabilizing a 14-3-3:
GCN1 complex, resulting in GCN1 downregulation (Figure 6I).
A Single Application of FC-A Reduces Corticospinal
Axon Die-Back after Dorsal Hemisection Spinal Cord
Injury
The damaged CNS is characterized by the presence of growth
inhibitors including chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs)
produced by reactive glia. FC-A significantly improved neurite
outgrowth on aggrecan substrates, suggesting that it may be
efficacious in improving growth after injury in vivo (Figure S6).
We therefore sought to determine whether FC-A could improve
axon growth after a dorsal hemisection spinal cord injury, which
transects the entire corticospinal tract (CST). Mice received an
immediate local application of FC-A in a rapidly polymerizing
fibrin gel onto the injury site. CST axons were then anterogradely
traced by injecting biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the
motor cortex and the mice were analyzed on day 21 (Figure 7A).
Surgeries and analysis were performed blinded to the experimental condition in two independent cohorts. Mice that received
a single treatment of FC-A had a significant reduction in axonal
die-back away from the injury site compared to control mice
treated with vehicle-containing fibrin gel. While the cut axons
of control mice retracted an average distance of 72 mm, the

(B) Counts of GAP43+ regenerating axons (n = 4 PBS control, 3 13 FC-A-treated, and 5 23 FC-A-treated mice, *p < 0.05, ****p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA,

(C) Intravitreal injections of FC-A stimulate optic nerve regeneration (lesion site marked with asterisk, scale bar = 100 mm).
(D) GAP43 and CTB staining show double labeling of regenerating axons (lesion site marked with asterisk, arrowheads indicate double-positive axons).
(E) Brn3a staining shows loss of retinal ganglion cells after ONC in retinal flat mounts (scale bar = 100 mm).
(F) Quantification of retinal ganglion cell survival (n = 3 intact, n = 4 PBS control and 6 23 FC-A-treated mice). Data are presented as mean + SEM.

end-bulbs of FC-A-treated mice were within the lesion or in close
proximity to the lesion (Figures 7B and 7C). These results indicate that transient exposure to FC-A is sufficient to diminish
the collapse and retraction of severed axons in vivo.
FC-A Stimulates Optic Nerve Regeneration
Next, we determined whether FC-A could stimulate CNS axon
regeneration past the lesion with longer therapeutic exposure
using the optic nerve crush (ONC) model and intravitreal injections. To visualize FC-A distribution after intravitreal injection,
we generated an Alexa 488 FC-A conjugate. 488-FC-A was enriched in the retinal ganglion cell layer 1 day after injection, suggesting that it is readily taken up by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
(Figure S7A). We also examined retinal GCN1 expression by
western blot as a readout for activity. GCN1 was unchanged at
1 day post-injection, but significantly downregulated 3 days
post-injection. Intriguingly, GCN1 levels remained suppressed
7 days post-injection, suggesting a sustained effect (Figures
S7B and S7C). We next determined whether FC-A could induce
axon regeneration after ONC. Mice received either 1 or 2 intravitreal injections of FC-A (Figure 8A). Cholera toxin b (CTb) was
used to trace RGC axons and GAP43 staining was used to visualize and quantify actively growing fibers. Surgeries and analysis

1090 Neuron 93, 1082–1093, March 8, 2017

were performed blinded to the experimental condition. Treatment with a single injection of FC-A was insufficient to stimulate
axon regeneration; however, a second injection on day 7 resulted in significant regeneration at 100, 200, and 500 mm from
the lesion compared to control animals (Figures 8B and 8C).
Nearly all CTb+ axons were also GAP43+, indicating that the
axons were in a growth state (Figure 8D). We also assessed
RGC density in the retina using Brn3a as a marker. As expected,
ONC caused a massive loss of RGCs (70% loss of RGCs).
Interestingly, FC-A-did not improve RGC survival, indicating
that FC-A stimulates axon regeneration independent of cell survival (Figures 8E and 8F). These findings show that therapeutic
administration of FC-A can stimulate axon regeneration after
CNS injury and open the door to a new class of small molecules
that could be further optimized to repair CNS damage.
DISCUSSION
We have found that 14-3-3 adaptor proteins facilitate neurite
outgrowth and that 14-3-3 function is dynamically modulated
by phosphorylation. Antagonism of 14-3-3 function by phosphorylation increases during development of the cortex, suggesting that this may dampen the intrinsic growth capacity of

neurons. The similar effects we observed on neurite outgrowth
by manipulating the expression of 14-3-3 b, g, or z suggest functional redundancy. Moreover, because manipulating the expression of single isoforms was sufficient to elicit effects on neurite
outgrowth, we speculate that there is a limited pool of 14-3-3
proteins that are competent to bind to clients and that there is
an excess of clients available for 14-3-3 binding. Small changes
in 14-3-3 abundance could therefore have major impacts on cell
signaling. While a neuroprotective role for 14-3-3s has been reported in nervous system injury models (Shimada et al., 2013;
Yacoubian et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2014), these results suggest
that the promotion of 14-3-3 expression or activity may also
enhance repair of damaged axons.
We have discovered that pharmacological stabilization of
14-3-3 PPIs with FC-A stimulates axon regeneration. A single
treatment of the injured spinal cord prevents corticospinal fiber
die-back, a mild but encouraging result that serves as proof of
concept that even a brief exposure to FC-A after injury can
provide benefit. We then show that more sustained dosing with
FC-A is sufficient to induce axon regeneration past the lesion
using the optic nerve crush model. Although modest, it is important to note that the effect on optic nerve regeneration is independent of RGC survival. A recent interesting study reported a
benefit of similar magnitude with genetic overexpression of
Armcx1, a regulator of mitochondrial motility, and this was
accompanied by enhanced RGC survival (Cartoni et al., 2016).
Moreover, extensive long-distance axon regeneration elicited
by PTEN loss or overexpression of oncogenes is also accompanied by enhanced RGC survival (Belin et al., 2015; Sun et al.,
2011). Our results suggest that manipulation of 14-3-3 PPIs combined with neuroprotective drugs could maximize axon regeneration. FC-A is a member of the fusicoccanes, a family of small
molecules produced by plants and fungi. Cotylenin A, another
member of this family, as well as semi-synthetic FC-A derivatives
also act on 14-3-3 protein complexes (Anders et al., 2013;
de Boer and de Vries-van Leeuwen, 2012). This new activity of
FC-A may motivate the exploration of other fusicoccanes and
derivatives for axon regeneration activity and the subsequent
optimization of these small molecules.
We have identified GCN1 as an important target for FC-Ainduced neurite outgrowth. Our results suggest that FC-A
‘‘glues’’ 14-3-3 to GCN1, mediating its degradation by the proteasome. It is also possible that FC-A-induced 14-3-3 binding
to GCN1 impairs its interactions with other binding partners.
The role of the interaction between 14-3-3 and GCN1 under
baseline physiological conditions remains unknown. We found
that GCN1 loss of function promotes neurite outgrowth, suggesting that it is an intrinsic inhibitor of neurite extension.
GCN1 is solely known for its involvement in nutrient sensing
and regulation of translation in response to stress by activating
the eIF2a kinase GCN2 (Sattlegger and Hinnebusch, 2000). It
is interesting to speculate that GCN1 could also be engaged
by injury-induced stress and that stress response pathways
could be targeted to promote axon regeneration. It is also
possible that GCN1 has an important function in axon outgrowth
and guidance during nervous system development, but this remains to be explored. Interestingly, it has been shown that
knockdown of GCN2 enhances spontaneous neuritogenesis

and that cultured neurons from GCN2 knockout mice have
enhanced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, IMPACT, a protein that
binds to GCN1 and antagonizes its interaction with GCN2, promotes neurite outgrowth (Roffé et al., 2013). However, the mechanisms by which these pathways regulate neurite outgrowth
are unknown. Our results suggest that protein synthesis may
not be required for FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth as both
CHX and anisomycin failed to fully block neurite outgrowth induction. There are no known functions of GCN1 or GCN2 outside
of the eIF2 pathway. Intriguingly, GCN1 harbors a series of
HEAT repeats that span the length of the protein. HEAT repeats
are domains that are thought to serve as a surface for PPIs
and scaffolding (Neuwald and Hirano, 2000). It is also possible
that GCN1-dependent activation of GCN2 leads to the phosphorylation of other substrates involved in axon growth and
regeneration.
The full repertoire of 14-3-3 PPIs that are stabilized by FC-A
has yet to be defined. Because FC-A persisted in stimulating
neurite outgrowth from GCN1 knockdown neurons at a high
100 mM concentration, it is likely that FC-A targets other
14-3-3:client complexes. Given the additional client proteins
for which FC-A has been shown to stabilize 14-3-3 binding, we
speculate that FC-A alters the 14-3-3 PPI network and has
effects on multiple clients. FC-A selectively binds to both C-terminal and internal 14-3-3:client interfaces that create a compatible pocket, dependent on client protein motifs (Stevers et al.,
2016). Importantly, further selectivity for specific motifs can be
achieved by chemically modifying the FC-A scaffold. For
instance, a semisynthetic derivative of FC-A with a fused tetrahydrofuran ring (FC-THF) has been devised to be selective for
14-3-3:client complexes that form an empty pocket in the binding groove when 14-3-3 binds to the C terminus of client proteins
(Anders et al., 2013). The ability of such modifications to attain
specificity for 14-3-3:client complexes raises the exciting possibility of designing compounds that can target specific 14-3-3
PPIs. Further discovery and optimization of compounds to target
these interactions could result in the development of new tools to
study 14-3-3s and new leads for drug development.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Primary rodent neuron cultures
All studies were approved by the McGill University Animal Care and Use Committee. For cortical neuron cultures, cortices from male
and female embryos were dissected from E18-19 Sprague Dawley rat or E16-17 CD-1 mouse in cold Leibovitz L15 medium (Thermo
Fisher). Isolated cortices were incubated in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and dissociated into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration.
Neurons were seeded onto culture dishes coated with 100 mg/mL poly-l-lysine (PLL). For reseeding of neurons onto aggrecan substrate, triplicate wells in a 96-well plate were coated with 0.5, 1 or 2 mg aggrecan for 2 hr at 37 C. Culture medium consisted of
Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 1% N2, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2mM L-glutamine.

Human fetal neuron culture
Human fetal brain tissue (male and female, 16–18 gestational weeks) was acquired from the Human Fetal Tissue Repository (Albert
Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). Tissue was dissociated in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and 25 mg/mL DNase and then passed
through a 140 mm nylon mesh. Neurons were seeded onto culture dishes coated with 100 mg/mL PLL. Culture medium consisted
of Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 1% N2, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine.
Animals
Adult female C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks of age) were used for spinal cord injury studies. Age and sex matched C57BL/6 mice (male
and female, 8-14 weeks of age) were used for optic nerve crush studies. Experimental conditions were randomized and surgeries
were performed blinded to the experimental condition.
METHOD DETAILS
Lentiviral production and infection
Lentiviruses were produced in HEK293T cells using a 3rd generation system. HEK293T were grown in DMEM 10% fetal bovine serum
to 80% confluence in 15cm plates and transfected (Lipofectamine 2000) with pRRL 14-3-3 shRNA or 14-3-3-myc plasmid (27 mg)
along with packaging plasmids, pMD2g (8 mg), pMDLg (13 mg) and pRSV-Rev (6.5 mg) and viral supernatants were collected over a
period of 2 days. Purified virus was isolated by overnight centrifugation at 7500 g and subsequently titered in HEK293T cells. Rat
cortical neurons were infected overnight with purified lentiviruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for knockdown or 2-3 for overexpression of 14-3-3 isoforms. The following day, the medium was replaced and half was replenished every 3-4 days thereafter.
Immunoblotting
Cortical neurons were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer composed of 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 10%
glycerol and 1% NP-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium fluoride and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). For retinal and cortex lysates, retinae or cortices were collected,
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently pulverized in complete lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates were boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE
and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk TBS-T for 1 hr, probed with primary antibody for 1 hr at
room temperature or overnight at 4 C and probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. The
following primary antibodies were used: anti-pan-14-3-3 (1:5000, RRID: AB_626618), anti-pan-14-3-3-HRP (1:5000, RRID:
AB_626618), anti-14-3-3b (1:5000, RRID: AB_626617), anti-14-3-3g (1:2000, RRID: AB_2217962), anti-14-3-3z (1:5000, RRID:
AB_2218378), anti-14-3-3z phospho-S58 (1:2000, RRID: AB_867443), anti-myc clone 9E10 (1:1000, RRID: AB_439694), antiGCN1L1 (1:500, RRID: AB_1925025). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
Neurite outgrowth assays
Cortical neurons were seeded in 96-well plates at 7,000 cells per well. After 2hr, medium was replaced with fresh culture medium
containing vehicle or indicated doses of FC-A, Y27632, BV02, KT5720, or Rapamycin. On day 1 of culture (DIV1) the neurons
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/20% sucrose, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X, blocked with 5% BSA, and stained with
anti-bIII tubulin (1:1000, RRID: AB_2313773 or AB_10063408), Hoechst 33342 (1:10000) and fluorescent secondary antibodies
(1:1000). Apoptotic cells were identified by TUNEL staining (in situ cell death detection kit TMR red, Roche #12156792910). For
human fetal neurite outgrowth, cultures were treated with FC-A on DIV2 and fixed and stained on DIV4. For re-seeding of neurons
infected with lentiviruses, neurons in 6-well plates were incubated with 0.125% trypsin in Neurobasal medium for 10min at 37 C,
gently triturated, replated in 96-well plates at 7,000 cells per well, treated with vehicle or 25 mM FC-A and grown for an additional
3 days before fixing and staining. For overexpression of WT, S58A and S58E 14-3-3z (kindly provided by Dr. Kwang Youl Lee,
(Gu et al., 2006)) dissociated rat cortical neurons were electroporated with a 2 mg:1 mg mixture of 14-3-3 plasmid and a plasmid encoding EGFP and fixed and stained on DIV2; for knockdown of GCN1, mouse cortical neurons were electroporated with a 2 mg:1 mg
mixture of GCN1 shRNA plasmid and a plasmid encoding EGFP and fixed and stained on DIV3; for overexpression of difopein-YFP
(kindly provided by Dr. Haian Fu, (Masters and Fu, 2001)) cortical neurons were electroporated with 2 mg difopein-YFP or a plasmid
encoding GFP; for rescue of 14-3-3 knockdowns, cortical neurons were electroporated with a 1 mg:2 mg mixture of pRRL 14-3-3
shRNA and RNAi resistant pRRL 14-3-3-myc. Electroporations were performed using the Nucleofector kit, Lonza, program O-003
for rat or O-005 for mouse neurons in Mirus electroporation solution (MIR50111). Automated image acquisition and analysis were
performed using an ImageXpress system and the neurite outgrowth module of the MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices). All
assays were performed with 3-12 replicates per condition from 3-6 independent experiments.
Scratch assays
Rat cortical neurons were seeded in 96-well plates at 30,000 cells per well, half the medium was replenished every 3-4 days and on
DIV10, a scratch was made across the center of each well with a plastic P10 pipet tip. Immediately after scratching, compounds
were added to the wells. The following day, the cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/20% sucrose, permeabilized with

e3 Neuron 93, 1082–1093.e1–e5, March 8, 2017

0.2% Triton-X, blocked with 5% BSA, and stained with anti-bIII tubulin (1:1000) or anti-Tau-1 (1:500, RRID: AB_2139842) or anti14-3-3z (1:1000), Alexa-568-phalloidin (1:1000) and fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:1000). Images of bIII tubulin stained axons
were acquired in the center of each scratch and thresholded in ImageJ. The outline of each scratch was traced and the percent area
of bIII tubulin stained neurites in the central 70% of the scratch was measured in ImageJ. All assays were performed with 6-12 replicates per condition from 3 independent experiments.
Fusicoccin-A conjugates
For conjugation of FC-A to beads, the vinylic carbon on the sugar group of FC-A was oxidized to generate an aldehyde as previously
described (Feyerabend and Weiler, 1987). Briefly, FC-A dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) was oxidized with OsO4 and NaIO4 to
generate FC-A-aldehyde. The following day, the product was loaded onto a Sep Pak C18 cartridge (Millipore Waters) and eluted
with methanol. The efficiency of FC-A-aldehyde formation was determined by thin layer chromatography and the FC-aldehyde
was then incubated with magnetic SiMAG hydrazide-beads (Chemicell) to couple the FC-A-aldehyde to the beads through the formation of hydrazone bonds. Unreacted sites were blocked with glyceraldehyde. Magnetic beads coupled to glyceraldehyde were
used as control beads. The same strategy was used to couple FC-A to Alexa 488-hydrazide.
Affinity chromatography with Fusicoccin-A
Rat cortical neurons were plated in 10 cm dishes and on DIV7 the neurons were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer composed of 100 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol and 1% NP-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete
protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium fluoride and 1mM sodium orthovanadate). Lysates
were clarified by centrifugation and protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). 1.5mg of lysate was added
to 30 mL pre-washed control beads or FC-A-beads in 500 mL lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated with the beads and vehicle or 10 mM
R18 or 100 mM FC-A for 2hr at 4 C with rotation and subsequently washed 3 times with lysis buffer and boiled in 2X SDS sample buffer
for western blot analysis.
Mass spectrometry analysis
For mass spectrometry, FC-A beads were washed 5 times and resuspended in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5 with 1 mg of
trypsin (Promega) and incubated at 37 C overnight with agitation. The next day, an additional 1 mg of trypsin was added and samples
were incubated for 3 hr at 37 C. Beads were pelleted and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Beads were then rinsed two
times with 100 mL of MS-grade water. All supernatants were combined and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Tryptic peptides were
resuspended in 15 mL of 5% formic acid; 5 mL were used per analysis.
An Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Scientific) and coupled to a UltiMate
3000 nanoRSLC (Dionex/Thermo) was used for peptide analyses. Mass spectra were acquired using a data dependent acquisition
mode using Thermo XCalibur software version 3.0.63. Full scan mass spectra (350 to 1800 m/z) were acquired in the orbitrap using an
automatic gain control target of 4e5, a maximum injection time of 50 ms and a resolution of 120 000. Selected ions were isolated using
the quadrupole analyzer in a window of 1.6 m/z and fragmented by higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with 35% of
collision energy. The resulting fragments were detected by the linear ion trap at a rapid scan rate. Dynamic exclusion of previously
fragmented peptides was set for a period of 20 s and a tolerance of 10 ppm.
All MS/MS peak lists were generated using Thermo Proteome Discoverer version 1.4.0.288 (Thermo Scientific). MGF sample files
were then analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4.0) and X! Tandem (The GPM, thegpm.org; version
CYCLONE (2010.12.01.1). Both were set up to search Uniprot Rattus norvegicus database (November 2014 release, 37218 entries)
assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. They were searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.60 Da and a parent ion tolerance
of 10 ppm. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Deamidated of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation
of methionine and phospho of serine, threonine and tyrosine were specified as variable modifications. Two miscleavages were
allowed.
Mass Spectrometry data analysis
Scaffold (version 4.0.1, Proteome Software) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 1.0% and contained at least 1 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (PMID: 14632076). Proteins
that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles
of parsimony.
MS data were analyzed with SAINTexpress, a simplified version of the Significance Analysis of INTeractome method described
previously (PMID: 24513533) via the CRAPome website (PMID: 23921808). SAINT probabilities were calculated using MS data
from control beads. The average probability is reported as the final SAINT score in the table. Preys with an average greater or equal
to 0.9 were considered ‘‘true’’ interactors (Table S1).

Co-immunoprecipitation
Rat cortical neurons were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer composed of 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 10%
glycerol and 0.5% NP-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. 1.5mg of cell lysate was pre-cleared with protein
A/G beads (Santa Cruz, sc-2003) and subsequently incubated with 1 mg of anti-GCN1L1 and vehicle or 50 mM FC-A for 2hr at 4 C with
rotation. Beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and boiled in 2X SDS sample buffer for western blot analysis. Blots were probed
with anti-GCN1L1 (1:500, RRID: AB_1925025) and anti-pan-14-3-3-HRP (1:5000).
Dorsal hemisection spinal cord injuries
Adult female C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks of age) were deeply anesthetized with ketamine:xylazine:acepromazine (50:5:1 mg/kg) and a
laminectomy was done to expose the T9 thoracic spinal cord. Dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord was performed with spring microscissors to cut through the central canal. 200 mg FC-A solubilized in a 1:3 stock of ethanol:PBS was diluted in a thrombin solution into
a final volume of 25 mL, quickly mixed with 25 mL of a fibrinogen solution and immediately applied directly onto the injury site, forming a
viscous gel. Thrombin and fibrinogen solutions were purchased as a kit (Evicel Fibrin Sealant). Mice received 0.2 mL bilateral injections of 10% biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the sensorimotor cortex with a glass pipette. On day 21, mice were transcardially
perfused with 4% PFA and the spinal cord was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. 25 mm longitudinal sections were collected on slides,
incubated in 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for 3hr, and overnight with streptavidin complex (Vector Laboratories). Sections were reacted
with diaminobenzidine to visualize the streptavidin–biotin–dextranamine complex and counterstained with methyl green. Scar borders were determined from the methyl green stain and quantification of axonal die-back distance was assessed blinded to the experimental condition by measuring and averaging the distances between the 5 closest end-bulbs from the edge of the lesion. Animals
that had incomplete lesions were excluded from the study. Sample sizes were based on previous spinal cord injury studies (Liu et al.,
2010). All surgeries were randomized and performed blinded to the experimental condition in two independent cohorts.
Optic nerve crush
Age and sex matched C57BL/6 mice (male and female, 8-14 weeks of age) were anesthetized with isoflurane and an incision was
made above the left orbit. Under a surgical microscope, the extra-ocular muscles were resected to expose the underlying optic
nerve. The optic nerve was crushed 0.5-1 mm behind the optic nerve head with fine forceps (Dumont #5) for 10 s. Care was taken
to avoid damaging the ophthalmic artery. Vascular integrity of the retina was assessed by a fundus examination. For intravitreal injections, a small puncture was made in the sclera with a 30-gauge needle and 2 mL of PBS or FC-A (1 mg/mL solution in PBS) was
injected into the wound using a Hamilton syringe. The needle was held in place for 2 min to avoid reflux and the puncture was sealed
with surgical glue. Mice that had significant reflux were excluded from the study. Injections of PBS or FC-A were performed immediately after injury and again 7 days after injury. Cholera toxin injections (1 mL) were performed on day 12-13. Mice were transcardially
perfused with 4% PFA on day 14. Optic nerves and eyes were harvested on day 14 and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2hr. Retinal flat
mounts were prepared and stained with anti-Brn3a (0.3 mg/mL, RRID: AB_2167511). Optic nerves were cryoprotected in 30%
sucrose at 4 C overnight and embedded in OCT. Longitudinal sections (14 mm thickness) were collected on slides, permeabilized
and blocked with 0.3% Triton-X in 5% BSA for 1hr at room temperature, stained with anti-GAP43 (1:1000, RRID: AB_10005026) overnight at 4 C, washed 3 times with PBS and stained with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000). Sample sizes were
based on previous optic nerve injury studies (Chandran et al., 2016). All surgeries and injections were randomized and performed
blinded to the experimental condition.
Regeneration and survival quantification
The number of regenerating axons visualized by GAP43 staining were counted at distances of 100, 200, 500 and 1000 mm from the
lesion. The estimated total number of regenerating axons Sad per nerve with a radius r, in a section with thickness t, at a distance
d from the lesion was determined using the formula Sad = pr2 x (axons/mm width) x t, as previously described(Yin et al., 2003).
Axon counts were performed blinded to the experimental condition from 3-4 sections per mouse. Mice that had GAP43+ axons
near the optic chiasm reflecting spared fibers were excluded from the study. To determine the RGC density per mm2, Brn3a+
RGCs were counted in ImageJ (Morquette et al., 2015).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All statistical tests were performed with GraphPad Prism 6. As indicated in figure legends, the following statistical tests were used:
unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett, Bonferroni or Fisher’s LSD post-test, Two-way
ANOVA with Dunnett or Bonferroni post-test. Sample sizes are indicated in figure legends and significance was defined as
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. NS = not significant.
